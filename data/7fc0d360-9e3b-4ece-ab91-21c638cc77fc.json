Being located in strategic geographic areas, under military threats and in the conditions of the ongoing war, the former soviet countries Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine continue to face numerous challenges and many difficulties in this matter.\nThe proliferation of dual-use CBRN goods and technologies leads to major risks for the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and systems that pose threat to global stability and security, especially given the situation in the world where terrorism, extremism, and international conflicts are very relevant.\nThe dual-use CBRN goods and technologies are considered strategic for security reasons or due to international agreements and are generally suitable to be used for military purposes of such importance that their export is either prohibited altogether or subject to specific conditions. The term strategic goods refer to both military goods (named also as single use goods) and dual-use goods. Lack of knowledge in this vast and sufficiently important domain creates preconditions for both terrorist and extremist criminal groups for goods and technologies proliferation to build weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, posing threats to national and regional stability and security.\nElaboration of the Handbook on Customs Clearance and Customs Control of Dual-Use Goods is widely recognized as an efficient practice for providing knowledge and awareness to all stakeholders involved in the international trade of strategic goods, as well as customs control and enforcement. As a rule, these manuals are subject to regular updates due to the rapid industrial and technological development in the world.\nTo improve the export control system and make it more useful, it is first and foremost important to raise the level of knowledge and awareness of the national export control customs officers. The Handbook aims at the analysis and systematization of the EU policy in the field of dual-use goods and technologies export control, highlighting the national particularities for carrying out control procedures when moving dual-use goods across customs borders. This manual has been created to provide customs specialists and other stakeholders with reliable information on the legal framework concerning the main customs procedures related to strategic goods and will help them better deal with export control issues in their day-to-day work, guide how to easily solve problematic issues with dual-use goods transactions, and provide up-to-date information.\nThe Handbook was designed as a comprehensive guide, offering detailed insights into the intricacies of customs operations, regulations, and specific procedures prevalent in Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova. It stands as a valuable resource, elucidating the nuances and distinctive features of customs practices within the GUAM member states.\nThe Annexes to the Handbook serve as a reference point, and delineate countries' unique customs landscape, encompassing import and export protocols, tariff structures, documentation requisites, risk management systems, liability for violations, national control lists, and relevant peculiarities of transporting dual-use goods. Focusing on the nuances of each country's export control framework, it offers valuable insights into the regulations, licensing requirements, and compliance measures governing the export of strategic goods within the region. Each participating country's export control system is comprehensively designed to enforce international agreements, prevent the illicit transfer of sensitive goods, and uphold national security interests while facilitating legitimate trade.\n\n\nThe working group:\nViorel DOAGA\nVitalie STRATAN\nAna TODERAS\nTatiana URSU\nAlina TURCANU\n\n\nREPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA\nSection 1. A brief overview of international and national legislation\n1.1. A brief overview of international legislation\nInternational Conventions and Treaties\nThe provisions of international treaties, agreements and conventions, as well as the relevant United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions on Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD), are the major international non-proliferation standards for signatory States, being legal supported by the most national governments.\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nThe objective of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in order to achieve the nuclear disarmament. The Treaty obliges the signatory states to regulate trade in nuclear weapons, explosive nuclear devices, fissionable special sources or materials, as well as related equipment and materials. \nThe provisions of the NPT, particularly article II, envisage that each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transfer or whatsoever of nuclear weapons, or other nuclear explosive devices, or of control over such weapons, or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\nArticle III, paragraph 2 sets out that each State Party to the NPT to control export of specified nuclear materials, and undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.\nThe NPT established a guarantee scheme under the responsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is authorized to inspect and verify the fulfilment of the provisions of the Treaty. The IAEA Secretariat, with the active sustaining of the EU and several Member States, carries out different support activities under the Additional Protocol, the Small Quantities Protocol, including organization of nuclear safeguards seminars.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a multilateral treaty that bans all nuclear explosions, for both civilian and military purposes, in all environments. The nuclear testing regime is designed to detect any nuclear explosions on the ground, underground, underwater, or atmosphere. The purpose of the verification regime is to monitor compliance with the provisions of the CTBT, which fully proxies nuclear explosions.\nThe verification regime consists of the following elements: International Monitoring System, International Data Centre, and Global Communication Infrastructure and field inspections.\nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction \nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC) aims to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons by States Parties. States Parties, in turn, must take the steps necessary to enforce that prohibition in respect of persons (natural or legal) within their jurisdiction.\nAll States Parties have agreed chemically disarm by destroying any stockpiles of chemical weapons they may hold and any facilities, which produced them, as well as any chemical weapons they abandoned in the past on the territory of other States Parties. States Parties have also agreed to develop a verification regime for certain toxic chemicals and their precursors (listed in List 1, 2 and 3 in the Annex on Chemicals) in order to ensure that such chemicals are only used for purposes not prohibited under the CWC.\nThe Convention is an arms control treaty that outlaws the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and their precursors. The purpose of the Convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their destruction is to stop the development, production, storage and use of chemical weapons worldwide. CWC is the first binding multilateral treaty to eliminate an entire category of WMD within a fixed timeframe.\nThe CWC obliges States Parties to implement a controlling system of production and trade of certain chemicals, the so-called scheduled chemicals. Signatory countries must have a registration and authorization system for these categories of chemicals (included in the so-called \"lists\"). The chemical industry and companies must provide regular information on production, processing, use and import / export / transit of chemicals. The designated national authority hands over this information to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\nThe CWC Annex on Chemicals contains three lists of chemical agents and precursors, the trade of which is properly regulated in the States Parties.\n•        List no. 1: Specify the agents and precursors, which refer directly to chemical weapons and are not used or used in insignificant quantities for other purposes.\n•        List no. 2: Enumerate the chemicals for limited trade and refers to chemical weapons.\n•        List no. 3: Contain the dual use chemicals and broad commercial destination.\nAccording to Article I of the CWC, States Parties undertake not to create, produce, acquire, store, or transfer chemical weapons (directly or indirectly) to other persons.\nThe CWC inspection is truly pioneered in international law. This means that any State Party that has doubts about compliance with the rules established by another State Party may request the Director-General to send an inspection team. In this inspection procedure, the States Parties to the CWC, undertake to respect the principle of inspections \"anytime and anywhere\" without a right of refusal.\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was set up to implement the provisions of the CWC in order to achieve the vision of a world free of chemical weapons and threat, where chemistry is designated exclusively for peaceful purposes, for progress and prosperity. The OPCW and its member states continue to commit themselves as states that are not parties to the OPCW to understand the value of the CWC and its contribution to regional and international peace and security. The CWC Universal Action Plan, developed in 2003, guides these activities.\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and of their Destruction \nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BTWC) is successor of the \"Protocol prohibited the use in war of asphyxiating, toxic or similar gases and bacteriological means\" (adopted by the League Nations, Geneva, June 17, 1925). It is the first Universal Treaty that prohibited the development, production, acquisition, transfer, retention, storage and use:\n•        of biological agents and toxins \"of types and quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes\";\n•        weapons, equipment and delivery vehicles \"designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile or armed conflicts\".\nAccording to the Article III of the BTWC, States Parties to the convention undertake not to transfer to any beneficiary, either directly or indirectly, and in any way assist, induce or imply any state, group of states or international organizations in production or acquisition, in other ways, microbial or other biological or toxin substances (regardless of their origin or method of production), the type and quantities of which do not comply with preventive, protective or other peaceful purposes.\nUnlike the CWC, the BTWC does not have an evidence mechanism to monitor compliance, and the negotiations on the creation itself have not been finalized so far. The treaty regime mandates States Parties to deal with compliance issues; consults each other and allows them to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council.\nFollowing the evolution of more sophisticated and complex terrorist threats and actions, there has been a clear interest in implementing the BTWC and ensuring worldwide participation. States Parties have agreed to promote the effective implementation of the BTWC at national level, including integration into education, mobilization, and awareness. In this respect, a small support unit for BTWC implementation, responsible for information, was created within the Geneva Branch of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs. The Council of the European Union approved a decision (PESC) in support of BTWC. Education, information and awareness-raising activities take place within the scientific, professional and academic associations, organizations and institutions of the States Parties.\nThe Arms Trade Treaty \nThis Treaty provides that each state party shall adopt measures aimed at the implementation of national laws and regulations leading to the successful implementation of the Treaty's provisions.\nArticle 15 refers to the States Parties powers, which provide mutual assistance for investigation, prosecution and judicial proceedings related to the violation of the national legal obligations established by the Treaty.\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (UNSCR 1540)\nThe United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR 1540) (2004) is the pillar of the international community efforts in the field of Strategic Trade Control (STC).\nThe Resolution sets out obligations (in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter) of Member States to develop and implement legal and regulatory measures appropriate to the non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, the dissemination of weapons of destruction. It is worth noting that this resolution recognizes non-state proliferation as a threat to international peace and security (Chapter VII of the UN Charter).\nThe UNSCR 1540 decided that all States shall refrain from providing any form of support to non-State actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes. The resolution requires all States to adopt and enforce appropriate laws to this effect as well as other effective measures to prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery to non-State actors, in particular for terrorist purposes.\nBy virtue of its universal and binding character, UNSCR 1540 marks a deviation from previous non-proliferation agreements and adds a new level to the non-proliferation regime. Until the resolution was adopted, the non-proliferation regime was based on numerous overlapping agreements that did not impose binding universal obligations.\nUNSCR 1540 supports and relies on certain obligations to regulate the various types of commercial transactions specified in international treaties and agreements, and states that all states must establish effective systems for regulating trade in ADM related materials.\nUNSCR 1540 provides that States:\n•        refrain from supporting countries that are not part of this resolution and who are trying to develop, supply, produce, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and means of delivery;\n•        develop and implement measures to detect, discourage, prevent and combat broker activity with such objects;\n•        establish, develop, revise the laws and regulations governing export, re-export, transit, transshipment, including financing and related services, and conduct national end user controls.\nThe RM regularly reports to UNSCR 1540 Council Committee the fulfilment of its commitments. Four national reports (2004, 2005, 2007, and 2013) were presented. Based on them, the UNSCR Matrix 1540 for RM has been revised (2004, 2005, 2008, and 2013).\n \nInternational Export Control Regimes for Dual-Use Goods\nThe Hague Code of Conduct against proliferation of ballistic missiles (HCOC)\nThe Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) was adopted on 25-26 November 2002. It complements the MTCR and is the only multilateral instrument for transparency and confidence building on ballistic missile proliferation. HCOC is a negotiated multilateral code outside the context of the UN system and recognized through multiple United Nations Resolutions on Missile Technology Control Regime. RM is part of the HCOC from 2002.\nSecurity Initiative against Proliferation (PSI)\nThe Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a voluntary global initiative launched by US President George W. Bush in 2003. It is a global effort that aims to stop trafficking of WMD, their delivery systems, and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. The PSI conducts information activities to identify, develop and promote the capabilities and critical practices of PSI within the PSI community, organizes lectures, exercises and mobilization seminars.\nThe Prohibition Principle Declaration, which includes all PSI participants, provides common standards for banning proliferation-relevant cargo. The 2013 political summit identified four critical capacities and practices:\n1.     prohibition of proliferation;\n2.     searching for and identifying illicit goods related to WMD;\n3.     seizure and disposal thereof; and\n4.     taking decisions quickly in cases of interdiction.\nContainer Security Initiative (CSI)\nAs the single, unified border agency of the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) mission is extremely important to the protect territory and people. Within months of terrorist attacks from 11 September 2001, U.S. Customs Service had created the Container Security Initiative (CSI).\nCSI addresses the threat to border security and global trade posed by the potential for terrorist use of a maritime container to deliver a weapon. CSI proposes a security regime to ensure all containers that pose a potential risk for terrorism are identified and inspected at foreign ports before they are placed on vessels destined for the United States. U.S. CBP has stationed teams of U.S. U.S. CBP Officers in foreign locations to work together with the host foreign government counterparts. Their mission is to target and pre-screen containers and to develop additional investigative leads related to the terrorist threat to cargo destined to the U.S.\nCSI is now operational in ports in North America, Latin America and Central America, Europe, Africa, Asia, including the Middle East.\nThe three core elements of CSI are:\n•        Identify high-risk containers, U.S. CBP and Border Protection's CBP uses automated targeting tools to identify containers that pose a potential risk for terrorism, based on advance information and strategic intelligence.\n•        Pre-screen and evaluate containers before they are shipped. Containers are screened as early in the supply chain as possible, generally at the port of departure.\n•        Use technology to pre-screen high-risk containers to ensure that screening can be done rapidly without slowing down the movement of trade. This technology includes large-scale X-ray and gamma ray machines and radiation detection devices.\nThrough CSI, custom officers work with host customs administrations to establish security criteria for identifying high-risk containers. Those administrations use non-intrusive inspection (NII) and radiation detection technology to screen high-risk containers before they are shipped to U.S. ports.\nMultilateral embargos\nIt is important to analyze periodically information on embargoes, as they may vary from one country to another, depending on how the embargo is implemented. For example, some EU  embargoes directly implement UN decisions; others modify the geographical scope or coverage of the included types of weapons. Countries have the right to implement their own embargoes, regardless of those applied by the UN.\nMultilateral export control regimes\nThere are following four main MECR:\n•        The Nuclear Suppliers Group\n•        The Australia Group\n•        The Wassenaar Agreement\n•        The Zangger Committee.\nThese are volunteer consensus-based units that empower States to exchange sensitive information on commodities, software and technologies related to WMD, including conventional weapons, and to set common standards for trade regulation.\nEach of them develops, maintains and updates the common control lists of the appropriate items, including the detailed description, technical specifications and the types of transactions, which Member States and adhering Member States should regulate them, including their application methods.\nThe adoption of MECR checklists and the integration of principles and directives into national laws and institutions are practical ways in which states tend to respect the international non-proliferation treaty and UNSCR 1540 obligations. As the MECR facilitates international legal compliance, and since many major suppliers and transit / transshipment countries all over the world are part of the MECR or adhere to the MECR directives, national review of checklists and their provisions is one of the best international practices in the field of strategic trade control.\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)\nThe focus of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is to limit the proliferation of missiles, rocket materials, full rocket systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and related technologies, designed for systems capable of carrying the payload of 500 kilograms at the distance of at least 300 km, as well as for ADM delivery systems. This regime also considers the challenges associated with intangible technology transfer as well as the importance of broker, transit and transshipment controls. The MTCR has grown to include 35-member countries that have agreed to coordinate their national export controls to stem missile proliferation.\nThe RM is part of MTCR (signed in 2013, ratified in 2015). The Initial Report (2016) and the First Annual Report (2017) have been presented so far.\nThe MTCR maintains a list of objects (Annex \"Equipment, Software and Technologies\"), the transfer of which is regulated by MTCR members and adherents.\nThe appendix is divided into two categories:\n•        Category I specifies complete rocket systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAE), subsystems and production capabilities that cannot be exported or exported in exceptional cases.\n•        Category II specifies full rocket systems and UAE not included in Category I as well as dual-use equipment, materials and technologies, which can be exported if the six criteria for the risks of incorrect use are, met (http://mtcr.info/guidelines-for-sensitive-missile-relevant-transfers/).\nNuclear Suppliers Group\nThe Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has the aim to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons through an appropriate export control system. The NSG contributes to restricting the export of sensitive items that may lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The NSG harmonizes the process of implementing export controls for nuclear, dual-use equipment, materials and technologies (including software). The goal of NSG is to implement two sets of guidelines for exports of nuclear dual use products and equipment. Through its activities, NSG seeks not to interfere with international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nThe Guidance on the Export of Materials, Equipment and Nuclear Technologies:\nGuidelines for nuclear Transfers (IAEA INFCIRC/254, Part 1)\nThe fundamental principles for safeguards and export controls should apply to nuclear transfers for peaceful purposes to any non-nuclear-weapon state and, in the case of controls on retransfers, to transfers to any State. In this connection, suppliers have defined the so-called trigger list. This list includes guidelines for nuclear transfers such as physical protection, safeguards, special controls on sensitive exports, special arrangements for export of enrichment facilities, controls on material usable for nuclear weapons, controls on retransfers as well as supporting activities.\nAnnexes of the guidelines govern the export of items that are especially designed or prepared for nuclear use. These include in the first annex (Annex A) material and equipment as well as technology associated with each of the items on the trigger list.\nThe second annex (Annex B) includes clarification of items on the trigger list:\n•        nuclear reactors and equipment there for;\n•        non-nuclear material for reactors;\n•        plants and equipment for reprocessing;\n•        plants and equipment for fabrication of nuclear fuel elements;\n•        plants and equipment for separation of isotopes;\n•        plants for heavy water production; and\n•        plants and equipment for conversion.\nA further annex (Annex C) describes criteria for levels of physical protection.\nGuidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials, software, and related technology (IAEA INFCIRC/254, Part 2)\nWith the objective of averting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and preventing acts of nuclear terrorism, suppliers have considered procedures in relation to the transfer of certain equipment, materials, software, and related technology that could make a major contribution to a “nuclear explosive activity,” an “unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle activity” or acts of nuclear terrorism. In this connection, suppliers have agreed on the following principles, common definitions, and an export control list of equipment, materials, software, and related technology.\nThis second set of NSG Guidelines governs the export of nuclear related dual-use items and technologies, that is, items that can make a major contribution to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activity, but which have non-nuclear uses as well, for example in industry. The list includes Guidelines for the transfer of dual-use goods, which are listed in the annex. The annex lists the following categories:\n•        industrial equipment;\n•        materials;\n•        uranium isotope separation equipment and components (other than trigger list items);\n•        heavy water production plant related equipment (other than trigger list items);\n•        test and measurement equipment for the development of nuclear explosive devices;\n•        components for nuclear explosive devices.\nThere is no formal link between the NSG and the UN, but by implementing NSG guidelines and annexes at national level, the NSG helps governments to fulfil their national export control obligations - in line with UNSCR 1540 and, in particular, Article III.2 of the NPT. Therefore, the NSG has set out the normative basis and legitimacy of the NPT, to which all NSG members are States Parties.\nAustralia Group\nAll states participating in the Australia Group (AG) are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and strongly support efforts under those Conventions to rid the world of CBW.\nThe purpose of the AG Group is to promote licensing / authorization measures among participating States by ensuring that export of specified chemicals, biological agents, dual-use chemical and biological production facilities and equipment does not contribute to the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. AG supports five lists of objects (common control lists) for export to which members of AG, adherents require a license / authorization:\n•        List of Chemical Weapons Precursors (including CWC List Items)\n•        List of production capacities, equipment, related technologies and software for the manufacture of dual-use chemicals\n•        List of equipment, related technologies and software for the production of dual-use biological products\n•        List of human and animal pathogens and toxins\n•        List of plant pathogens.\n•        The lists and the AG Guide are reviewed annually.\nThe AG Directive for the Transfer of Sensitive Chemical and Biological Substances provides certain key principles that AG members and adherents should consider in assessing trade with chemical, biological and other dual use related products. The directive aims to limit the risks of proliferation and terrorism related to chemical and biological weapons, empowering governments to carry out controls on tangible and intangible transfers of such objects to states or other non-state entities. The directive also provides for members to \"have or to take certain measures\", which would allow them to act appropriately in the case of broker services by looking at the items included in Joint Control Lists.\n \nWassenaar Agreement\nThe WA promotes transparency, information sharing, measures to encourage the transfer of conventional arms, dual-use goods and technology, and military destination. WA members establish and implement national policies that ensure transparent trade in accordance with the rules established for such objects that do not support the expansion of military capabilities that could undermine the regime's objectives or cause improper use.\nWA maintains two extensive control lists:\n•        List of ammunition that specifies conventional weapons, software, technology, parts and components, the marketing of which must be regulated by WA members and adherents\n•        Dual-use list of products and technologies that specify 10 categories of products, software and dual-use technologies, including materials, electronic technology, computers and special telecommunication objects.\nThe WA document \"Best practices for effective legislation on arms brokering\" stipulates the measures that participating States should consider, regulate arms brokering, including the registration and licensing of transactions. Another WA document, dedicated to \"Best Practices for Implementing Intangible Technology Transfer Control\", calls for States to rigorously control intangible transfers of dual-use items and technologies.\nThe WA Directive reiterates the importance of regulating transit, transshipment, brokering and re-export activities as well as guarantees to end-users, the role of scrutiny. WA implements an information program for stakeholders aimed at encouraging the adoption of WA standards and promoting an effective national export control. The WA organizes annual briefings, information seminars, workshops and other events.\nConcerning conventional weapons and dual-use goods, WA completes export control regimes aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nZangger Committee Also known as the \"NPT Exporters Committee\"\nThe Zangger Committee (ZC) was created after the entry into force of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aiming at the scientific interpretation of Article III, paragraph 2 of the NPT, on the harmonization of export control policies for nuclear materials.\nThe ZC was formed following the coming into force of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to serve as the \"faithful interpreter\" of its Article III, paragraph 2, to harmonize the interpretation of nuclear export control policies for NPT Parties.\nThe Committee has been focusing on what is meant in Article III, ph.2 of the Treaty by \"especially designed or prepared equipment or material for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material.\" The ZC maintains a Trigger List (triggering safeguards as a condition of supply) of nuclear-related strategic goods to assist NPT Parties in identifying equipment and materials subject to export controls.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the INFCIRC/209 series publishes the Trigger List and the Zangger Committee’s understandings\nAs circumstances change in the use of nuclear technology, ZC's mission under the NPT is to consider changing security aspects and adapting timely the conditions and criteria of control, depending on needs.\nProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\nGeneva Protocol is a treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. It was signed in Geneva on 17 June 1925 and entered into force on 8 February 1928. The Geneva Protocol is a protocol to the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War signed on the same date, and followed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.\nIt prohibits the use of \"asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices\" and \"bacteriological methods of warfare\". This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons, but has nothing to say about production, storage or transfer. Later treaties did cover these aspects — the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\nThe main elements of the protocol are now considered by many to be part of customary international law (BTWC).\n\n\n1.2. A brief of national legislation\nIn the Republic of Moldova, regulatory controls on strategic goods are based on the following acts, regulations, orders and measures. The texts of the instruments are publicly available at www.legis.md (in Romanian and Russian languages).\nLaw no.1163/2000 on the control of export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods[1], regulates the principles and procedure for controlling the export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods, establishes the general provisions on such activity in order to ensure Moldova's national security, to promote the foreign policy of the country and to participate in international efforts on control.\nGovernment Decision no. 606/2002 on the National System for Export Control, Re-export, Import and Transit of Strategic Goods in RM[2] ensures the implementation of the Law no.1163 / 2000 on export control, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods. This decision provides for the setting up of the Interdepartmental Commission for control, export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods (Interdepartmental Control Commission), as well as the Regulation of this Commission. It includes:\n•        Regulation of the interdepartmental commission (Annex 1);\n•        Regulation regarding the control regime of strategic goods (Annex 2);\n•        List of strategic goods subject to control (Annex 3). (In section 10 you can see the structure of the Control list)\nLaw no. 160/2011 on regulating through authorization the entrepreneurial activity[3] is an organic law that establishes the legal framework for regulation by authorizing the entrepreneurial activity in the Republic of Moldova, as well as the Nomenclature of permissive acts with approved authorities involved in the process of issuing the permissive act, including strategic and dual destination goods.\nLaw no. 132/2012 empowered The National Agency for Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activities for authorization of nuclear and radiological activities[4]. It should be noted, that the authorization issued by them does not exonerate the economic agent from authorization for import /export /re-export /transit for strategic goods obtaining from the Agency of Public Services. \nLaw no. 130/2012[5] regarding the weapon and ammunition regime with civil purpose, establishes the categories of weapons and ammunition for civilian use, as well as the conditions under which the procurement, alienation, possession, port, use of these weapons and ammunition and operations with them are allowed on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.\nCriminal Code of the Republic of Moldova no. 985/2002[6], article no. 13417 defines what strategic goods are and the punishment in case of violation of the current legislation in force.\nAt the same time Moldova is part of the main treaties and international agreements - the pillars of non-proliferation, adhering to or ratifying:\n•        Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. RM ratified it in 1994.\n•        The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). RM signed it in 1997, ratified in 2007.\n•        Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction (CWC). RM ratified it in 1995, in force 1997.\n•        Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BTWC). RM signed it in 2005.\n•        The International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, also known as The Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC). RM signed it in 2002.\nThe current legal framework offers the possibility of fair trade, as well as the coverage of money laundering, international sanctions, the non-proliferation of WMD etc. Considering an important fact that in the Art. no. 8 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova[7], it is obliged to comply with the provisions of the United Nations.\n \n\n\n[1] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136484&lang=ro#\n[2] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=137102&lang=ro#\n[3] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=138712&lang=ro#\n[4] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136567&lang=ro#\n[5] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136157&lang=ro#\n[6] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=137033&lang=ro#\n[7] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136130&lang=ro#\n\n\nSection 2. Structure of the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova and functions of its structural divisions\nShort history\nThe history of the customs system of the Republic of Moldova began after the proclamation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, more precisely on September 4, 1991. On that day, the Decree of the President of the Republic of Moldova no. 189 of 03.09.1991 \"Regarding the subordination of customs institutions located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova\". The normative act provided for the transfer of all customs structures on the territory of the Republic of Moldova to the management of the Government, composed at that time of Ungheni customs, Leușeni customs and Chisinau internal customs. Given the new realities, the customs system was formed as an emergency, with customs control posts being set up in a short time. Moreover, the newly created institution did not have enough staff, so it was necessary to hire a larger number of customs officials, who had to fulfill the basic mission of the institution, although they had a vague idea about the specifics of this activity. However, they quickly mastered the alphabet of the specialty and became good professionals. In 1992, the Ungheni and Leușeni customs offices were reorganized and created four new customs offices at the border with Romania: Sculeni, Costești, Cahul and Giurgiulesti. In addition, that year, were founded 22 customs control points at the border of the Republic of Moldova with Ukraine. Their activity was legalized on 20.03.1993, by signing of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \"On customs border crossing points\".\nThe first Customs Code - the basic legislative act that regulates the organizational and activity principles of the customs system was adopted on 09.03.1993.\nSince October 1994, the Republic of Moldova has become a full member of the World Customs Organization (WCO).\nThe role of Customs has grown more and more with the development of international trade, the customs authority being fully engaged in the continuous modernization process, with the strategic objective of increasing the contribution to the economic development of the country. Over the years, important institutional reforms were promoted in the customs system, which contributed to building a modern customs authority with European aspirations.\nThe major result of this period is the consolidation of a body of career officials, professional and impartial, capable of contributing to the achievement of the institution's major objectives, one of the most important being ensuring the economic security of the state. The golden fund of the Customs Service is the contingent of officials, who were employed in the customs bodies at the stage of their formation and remained devoted to this job. They have become a standard of professionalism and loyalty, assuming the risk of the transition period for the edification of the rule of law.\nHistorical data:\n04.09.1991 - Decree of the President regarding the subordination of customs institutions located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.\n1992 - 4 new customs offices were created at the border with Romania: Sculeni, Costești, Cahul, Giurgiulești, and the foundations were laid for the activity of 22 customs control points at the border with Ukraine.\n09.03.1993 - The first Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova is adopted.\n1994 - The Republic of Moldova became a member of the World Customs Organization (WCO).\n15.08.1995 - The President's Decree established the 4th of September \"Customs System Worker's Day\", which is celebrated annually.\n20.07.2000 - The Customs Code and the Law on service in customs bodies were adopted.\n01.06.2001 - The Republic of Moldova becomes a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nThe Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova is the administrative authority that carries out its activity under the Ministry of Finance, being a separate organizational structure in the administrative system of this ministry, established for the provision of public administrative services to customs payers, for the exercise and improvement of customs control, including on the legality of the introduction/ removing goods into/from the customs territory, performing customs formalities, creating the conditions for accelerating the traffic of goods across the customs border.\nThe Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova is the public administration body, which contributes to the development of the Republic of Moldova by ensuring the economic and fiscal security of the state, facilitating legitimate trade and offering quality public services to the business environment and citizens. For this purpose, the Customs Service ensures the administration of customs revenues, exercises control and supervision duties based on risk analysis and applies modern customs clearance techniques in a professional, transparent and responsible manner.\nThe Customs Service is a specialized public authority that exercises the effective management of customs activity in the Republic of Moldova through:\nimplementation of the customs policy,\nensuring compliance with customs regulations when goods, means of transport and people cross the customs border of the Republic of Moldova,\ncollection of import duties and export duties,\ncustoms clearance, customs control and supervision.\nThe duties of the customs body are regulated in Section 2, Article 11 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova:\nparticipates in the elaboration of the customs policy of the state and implements this policy;\nensures compliance with customs and fiscal legislation; defends the rights and legitimate interests of the person within the customs activity;\ncontribute, within the limits of competence, to ensuring the economic security of the state;\ndefends the economic interests of the state;\napply customs procedures for regulating economic and commercial relations;\ncollect import rights and export rights;\ncoordinates the application of the Combined Nomenclature of goods;\nmanages the Integrated Customs Tariff of the Republic of Moldova (TARIM);\nparticipates in the development of economic policy measures regarding the passage of goods across the customs border and applies these measures;\nfight against smuggling, the violation of customs regulations and fiscal legislation that refers to the passage of goods across the customs border, the illegal passage across the customs border of narcotic substances, weapons, art objects, objects of historical and archaeological value, intellectual property objects, species of endangered animals and plants (derivatives and their parts), other goods;\ncontributes to the prevention and combating of money laundering, as well as international terrorism;\nexercises and perfects customs control, performs customs clearance, creates conditions for speeding up the traffic of goods across the customs border;\ncontributes and participates in the elaboration of foreign trade customs statistics and special customs statistics;\ncontributes to the implementation of measures to protect state security, to ensure public and moral order, to protect people's lives and health, to protect flora and fauna, the entire environment, and to protect the internal market;\nexercise customs control over currency values, within the limits of competence;\nensures the fulfillment of the state's international obligations in the customs field; participates in the elaboration of international agreements in the customs field, in collaboration with customs bodies, with other public authorities from abroad, with international organizations in the customs field;\ncarry out scientific research, offer consultations in the field;\ndevelops the technical-material and social base of customs bodies, creates conditions for the activity of customs collaborators;\nmanages the origin certification system, in the cases established by the Government, including certifying the origin of the goods and issuing certificates of origin against payment for the export of the goods;\ncarry out the necessary activities for risk management;\nensures the dissemination of customs legislation and access to information of public interest;\ndevelops the public-private partnership in the customs field and collaborates with the business environment;\nexercise other duties established by legislation.\nStructure\nThe Customs Service is led by a director, assisted by 2 deputy directors, whose number is determined by the Government, upon the proposal of the Minister of Finance.\nStructure of the customs system:\nthe central apparatus - institution that ensures the coordination and monitoring of customs activity at the national level; elaborates normative acts in the customs field; ensures the management process and institutional development; ensures the representation of the Customs Service in relation to other public authorities, the business environment, society as well as externally.\ncustoms offices - territorial subdivisions of the Customs Service that ensure compliance with customs regulations in its area of competence. The customs system includes 3 customs offices: North Customs Office; Central Customs Office and South Customs Office\ncustoms posts - territorial units subordinate to the customs office, which ensure the collection of import duties, the application of the procedures provided by customs regulations, customs clearance and customs control. The customs posts ensure the completion of customs documents for road, rail, naval, fluvial, air transport as well as postal shipments. The structure of customs posts includes border customs posts (at the Moldovan-Ukrainian state border and at the Moldovan-Romanian border) and internal customs posts.\nIn this context, increased attention is paid to the personnel at the border crossing points in order to ensure the fluidity of the traffic of people and means of transport. At the same time, the modernized structure ensures the strengthening of the collaboration mechanisms between the central apparatus and the customs offices, as well as the efficiency of the internal control system.\n \nTHE STRUCTURE OF MOLDOVAN CUSTOMS SERVICE \n\n\nSection 3. Basic customs procedures\n\n\n3.1. Customs Procedures\nThe customs code of the Republic of Moldova No. 1149-XIV/2000 establishes the following notions:\n·        customs control – set of actions undertaken by the customs bodies for the application and compliance with the laws and regulations that the customs bodies are tasked with applying;\n·        release for free circulation - the action by which the customs body leaves the goods and means of transport unconditionally and without restrictions at the disposal of the person after customs clearance;\n·        customs regime - all the customs regulations that determine the status of goods and means of transport depending on the purpose of the operation and the destination of the goods;\n·        export - customs regime in which the goods are removed from the customs territory without the obligation to re-introduce them to this territory. Goods produced in the country, as well as those imported and put into free circulation previously, are admitted for export, with the exception of goods that are subject to prohibition or restriction measures within the framework of the economic policy.\n·        import - the customs regime in which the goods introduced into the customs territory receive the status of goods put into free circulation only after the import duties are paid and the economic policy measures are applied.\n·        transit - the customs regime in which the goods are transported on the customs territory under customs supervision from one customs body to another, without the collection of import and export rights and without the application of economic policy measures, unless the legislation provides otherwise. Goods prohibited from being introduced into the Republic of Moldova or restricted goods cannot be placed under the customs transit regime if the national legislation regulating the transit of these types of goods has not been respected.\n·        re-export - the customs destination that consists in the removal of foreign goods and means of transport, previously placed in a customs regime with an economic impact, in the customs destinations free zone or duty-free shop, from the customs territory without charging export rights and without applying economic policy measures, in accordance with this code and other normative acts.\nAny form of customs control is applied based on risk analysis, which determines the degree and forms of customs control: documentary control, physical control or exemption from control (respectively, the yellow, red or green lane). The process of selecting customs declarations per color is automated and managed by the integrated customs information system (the information and algorithms underlying the risk analysis are information for internal use by the customs and cannot be accessed by an economic agent).\nCustoms control is one of the important elements of the national control system of export, import, re-export and transit of strategic goods. The main objectives of customs control consist in the prevention of unauthorized export, import, re-export and transit, as well as the fight against smuggling, the violation of customs regulations, the identification, prevention and combating of violations of the order of movement of controlled goods at the customs border of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe general activity of the Customs Service is regulated by the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova No. 1149-XIV/2000. But the Customs Code refers only indirectly to the regulation of the movement of controlled goods. The regulation of this field is carried out on the basis of Law no. 1163/2000 regarding the control of the export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods in the Republic of Moldova and Government Decision no. 606 of 15.05.2002, other normative acts that regulate customs activity, as well as the international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party part.\nIn its control activities of export, import and transit of strategic goods, SV actively interacts with other members of the Interdepartmental Control Commission (CIC). This previously mentioned commission includes a customs official with a management position within the SV, because the SV is the body directly responsible for controlling the movement of goods across the customs border of the Republic of Moldova and controls the availability of export, re-export, import, transit documents for economic activity participants.\n\n\n3.2. Special features of customs clearance of goods and technologies included in national control lists\nGoods and technologies controlled for import and export are subject to customs control and mandatory clearance. Upon acceptance of the Customs Detailed Declaration (DVD), the customs officer checks the declared goods for signs of dual-use goods.\nThe signs of controlled goods are:\na) General signs:\n•          the correspondence of the tariff position of the declared goods, according to the Combined Nomenclature of goods from Law no. 172 of 25.07.2014 with the tariff positions in TARIM, specified in the \"Code of the tariff position of goods from external economic activity\" column in the control lists;\n•          the presence of information carriers, classified under tariff headings 4901100000, 4901990000, 4906000000, 4911910000, 4911990000, 8471300000, 8471410000, 8471490000, 84715000 00, 847170, 8523 (except gramophone records), of technical documentation in the form of software, technical reports -scientific, diagrams, models, formulas, technical designs and specifications, reference materials, instructions and other technical documents.\nb) Specific signs:\n•          correspondence of the name of the declared goods with the general technical name specified in the \"Name\" column of the control lists (according to Annex no. 3 of GD 606/2002);\n•          the correspondence of the declared goods with the goods used in the production of WMD, their means of delivery, other types of weapons and military equipment (according to Annex no. 3 of GD 606/2002).\nThe belonging of the goods to the controlled goods is determined by the correspondence of their technical parameters and the descriptions of the goods specified in the \"Name\" column of the control lists (according to Annex no. 3 of HG 606/2002). The codes listed in the control lists are for reference only, are used for auxiliary purposes and do not attest to the belonging of the goods to be declared as controlled products. The identification of goods for export control purposes, as well as the execution of all necessary actions, related to obtaining the authorization to carry out external economic transactions with goods included in the control lists, or the permission to export them from the Republic of Moldova without authorization is the responsibility of the economic agent of the Republic of Moldova to foreign trade activities.\nThe right to establish the conformity/non-conformity of the goods, which are the subject of external economic operations with the goods included in the control lists, according to the legislation of the Republic of Moldova, is granted to the CIC responsible for carrying out the activities of identification of the controlled goods in accordance with the procedure established by the Government of the Republic of Moldova.\n3.3. Customs Formalities\nWhen carrying out the documentary control, the customs official analyzes the information mentioned in the DVD and the content of the documents attached to it, in order to identify the signs of the controlled goods on the declared goods;\n·                    when identifying the signs of a controlled product on the declared goods, the authorized customs officer checks the presence of one of the following documents confirming the declared information about the goods: authorizations, certificates and other necessary documents, issued by ASP.\n·                    Pursuant to one of the above documents, the customs official verifies the correctness of entering the relevant information in section 44 of the DVD, according to SV Order no. 346-O of 24.12.2009.\nIn the absence of an authorization document, the customs official who performs a documentary control, in order to carry out an additional verification of the information about the possible belonging of a product to the controlled goods, in accordance with the procedure established by SV Order no. 480-O of 18.12.2006, redirects the DVD to the yellow aisle for the documentary control and consultation of the authorization and certification section of ASP.\nThe additional consultation with ASP representatives of the declared information about the product is carried out to guide the customs official on making the authorization decision in the manner established by the legislation of the Republic of Moldova in the field of export control, or releasing the goods without it.\nIn order to carry out additional control, commercial documents, technical documents on the goods presented by the declarant, as well as information received from law enforcement and regulatory authorities are examined. Technical documentation includes: form, passport, label, quality certificate for products, or similar documents issued by a direct manufacturer, providing the possibility of additional information to identify the goods (product).\nIn the absence of a set of confirmatory documents, technical documentation for the product, the customs officer requests a request or a notification regarding the need to present additional documents to be able to identify the declared goods.\nFurther examination includes the following steps:\na) checking the availability of technical documentation for the declared goods and their compliance with the following basic requirements:\n·        the documents contain the registration data of the organization that issued the document, as well as the necessary signatures and stamps;\n·        the copies are clearly distinguished and certified by the head of the company (signature, stamp on each sheet or file);\nb) verifying the correctness and identity of the product information entry in section 31 of the DVD and commercial documents. The name of the goods in the commercial documents must fully respect the name of the product in the technical documentation;\nc) work with the control lists, in order to:\n•        identification in the control lists of the positions in which the code from the Combined Nomenclature of goods is indicated;\n•        identification in the control lists of the general technical name of the declared goods;\n•        contrasting the name of the declared goods, the values of the technical parameters, specified in the technical documentation, with the general technical name, description and parameters of the controlled analogue product;\nd) studying commercial documents to identify signs that indicate the need for additional verification of external commercial transactions in terms of compliance with RM legislation in the field of export control;\ne) verification of the information received from the Directorate of risk analysis of the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova regarding the possible use of the declared goods in the production of WMD, their means of delivery, other types of weapons and military equipment, as well as the possible involvement of the end user of the goods or of the sender on violations of RM legislation in the field of export control;\nf) evaluation of the risk criteria associated with non-compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions regarding the movement of goods across the customs border of the Republic of Moldova, established by the Customs Service and the Customs Offices.\nBased on the generalization of the results obtained at all stages of the examination, the customs official receives one of the following decisions:\n•        the need to confirm the declared information about the product by submitting authorizations, certificates, issued by ASP;\n•        the release of goods without the need for authorizations, certificates, issued by ASP.\nThe reasons for the adoption of one of the listed decisions are indicated by the customs official, who will also complete the customs operation, in the Inspection Act on the DVD.\nIf the name of the declared product corresponds to the general technical name of the product included in the control lists, the customs officer shall:\nDecision 1: on the need to confirm the declared product information by submitting an authorization provided that:\na) the economic agent did not present the authorization issued by ASP and the technical documentation for this product;\nb) the technical documentation does not comply with the necessary requirements;\nc) the absence in the technical documentation of the name of the parameters or units of measurement of the technical characteristics, identical to those in the control list;\nd) correspondence of the declared product with its controlled counterpart according to its functional purpose, operating principle and technical similarity;\ne) availability of technical information on an information carrier in the form of software, scientific and technical reports, drawings, diagrams, models, formulas, technical projects and specifications, reference materials, instructions, etc. technical and technological documents (technical information sold through a retail distribution network is not subject to control);\nf) in other cases of justified doubts regarding the reliability of the declared data regarding the declared goods or the discrepancy between the declared products and the controlled analog ones.\nThe completed inspection report will exhaustively reflect:\na) the name of the position in the lists of controlled goods with which the declared goods correspond or can be correlated, with references to GD 606/2002 by which these lists are approved;\nb) other signs indicating the correlation or possible belonging of the declared goods with those controlled.\nThe decision regarding the possibility of releasing the goods is the responsibility of the customs official by consulting the ASP specialist.\nThe decision 2. regarding the possibility of release without authorization is taken by the customs official:\na) in case of non-compliance of the declared goods with the control lists based on the general signs;\nb) in the case of correlation of the declared goods with control lists based on general and specific or only specific signs – non-compliance of the declared goods with the requirements established for their technical analogue, provided in the control lists;\nc) in the absence of information, which indicates the need for additional verification of an external commercial transaction in order to comply with the legislation of the Republic of Moldova in the field of export control.\nIn this case the Inspection Act will exhaustively reflect:\na) the name of the position from the lists of controlled goods from Annex no. 3 GD 606/2002, with which the declared goods were compared;\nb) the de facto technical characteristics of the goods (in accordance with the technical documentation for the goods presented for customs clearance);\nc) the conclusion regarding the result of comparing the descriptions of the general technical name of the declared goods and the controlled analogue;\nd) the list of documents, used to substantiate the decision.\nThe adopted conclusion is entered by the customs officer in the Act of inspection of the DVD.\n\n\n3.4. Customs control of goods\nCONTROL OF IMPORTED GOODS\nIn order to ensure compliance with customs legislation, to prevent fraud, the customs authority applies various customs control procedures and tools.\nGoods and means of transport are subject to selective customs control. Selectivity provides that the customs authority uses, based on the risk analysis, those forms of control that are sufficient to ensure compliance with the legislation.\nNote: The customs authority is entitled, as appropriate, to use all forms of customs control.\nThus, in the customs clearance process, customs control is applied according to the degree of risk determined by the \"ASYCUDA World\" information system, which leads to directing customs declarations to one of the customs control lanes (green, blue, yellow or red):\n·                    the green corridor – the granting of customs clearance without performing documentary and physical control;\n·                    the blue corridor – the granting of customs clearance without performing the documentary and physical control, with the subsequent control based on the principle of selectivity being carried out through the reverification of the customs declaration;\n·                    the yellow corridor – performing the documentary control, without performing the physical control;\n·                    the red corridor - performing the documentary and physical control.\n \nI. Document control\nWhen performing the documentary control, the documents attached to the customs declaration are checked (at least the following mandatory documents: 1) the invoice; 2) transport documents; 3) permissive documents, necessary for granting customs clearance). At the same time, other documents can be additionally requested that confirm all the data indicated in the customs declaration and which are necessary for the granting of customs clearance.\nThe documents attached to the customs declaration must be presented to the customs authority in original, and in the case of the electronic declaration, the documents are scanned and attached to the customs declaration.\nIf the declarant has the documents required for customs clearance completed in foreign languages, the customs authority may request their translation.\nThe documentary control consists in verifying: the correctness of completing the customs declaration in detail; the existence of the documents attached to the customs declaration in detail, according to the requested customs destination; the agreement between the data entered in the customs declaration and those in the attached documents; the form of the attached documents.\n \nII. Physical control\nPhysical control consists in checking goods and means of transport with the aim of confirming information about the nature, origin, condition and quantity of the goods, the condition of seals, stamps and other means of identification.\nPhysical control can be carried out by: identifying goods, counting seats or parcels, weighing, measuring, photographing, taking samples and samples, applying special customs control equipment and other control tools in order to confirm the data indicated in the customs declaration and/or in the accompanying documents.\nThe customs authority can apply the following types of physical customs control of goods:\n- partial (with the verification of a part of the cargo lot, sufficient to ensure compliance with customs legislation);\n- total (with verification of the entire cargo lot). It is applied, in particular, in situations where there are solid indications of non-compliance with the customs legislation in force or when the selectivity criterion expressly indicates the need to check the entire batch of goods, as well as in cases where, based on the risk analysis, it has been established that a partial control will not be sufficient to ensure compliance with customs legislation;\n- carried out in order to take samples and samples for the research (expertise) of the goods.\nThe declarant and other holders of rights over goods and means of transport, as well as their representatives, are obliged to assist in the control of goods and means of transport and to provide assistance to the customs authority in carrying out the control.\nThe declarant or his representative is obliged, at the request of the customs body, to handle, unpack and repack the goods, without causing their degradation. The expenses related to these operations will be covered by the declarant.\nIf the declarant does not appear within 10 days from the presentation of the goods or the control cannot be postponed for security reasons or due to other circumstances that cannot be postponed, the customs will carry out the control in the absence of the declarant, but in the presence of persons not interested in the result the control.\nWhen carrying out customs control, technical means of control can be applied that do not pose any danger to the health and life of people, animals and plants and that do not cause damage to goods and means of transport. Customs has an arsenal of non-intrusive customs control equipment (scanners located at road border posts, at the airport and, in the near future, at the railway).\nCustoms also has customs laboratories, including mobile laboratories, which are used for the purpose of physical-chemical analysis of the goods, necessary for verifying the correctness of the goods declaration. The customs laboratory is accredited for several tests and specializes in the fields of textiles, alcohol, petroleum products, food products.\nThe customs control is carried out in no more than 5 calendar days from the moment of receipt of the declaration and the information necessary for the customs control or, in case of physical control, from the moment of their presentation to the customs authority. For goods required in case of natural calamity, catastrophe or accident, as well as in the case of live animals, easily perishable goods, radioactive substances, mass information materials, the duration of customs control is limited to 3 days.\n \nIII. Subsequent control (post-customs audit and reverification of customs declarations)\nThe subsequent control activity can be carried out by post-customs audit or by reverification of customs declarations.\nThe main objectives of the subsequent control are:\n·        to provide assistance to operators to overcome system errors and any deficiencies in understanding customs regulations;\n·        to verify the correctness and completeness of the data entered in the customs declarations; to verify whether the obligation to declare the goods or to provide information has been fully complied with; to check whether the regulations related to customs regimes have been correctly applied;\n·        to identify errors, detect violations of regulations or cases of fraud.\na) Post-customs audit\nThe post-customs audit is a subsequent control of the goods, after customs clearance, which aims to verify compliance with the legislation in force by the persons established in the Republic of Moldova at the time the goods cross the customs border of the Republic of Moldova and their placement under a customs destination.\nForms of subsequent control through post-customs audit:\n·                    general control – consists in checking all customs operations for a determined period;\n·                    partial control – consists in checking one or more customs operations for a determined period;\n·                    repeated control - is applied if the results of the subsequent control are inconclusive, incomplete or unsatisfactory or if new circumstances of fraud were subsequently detected.\n1. Subjects of the audit\nThe persons involved directly or indirectly, in a professional capacity, in the operations subject to the post-customs audit, or the persons who have the respective documents and data for professional reasons, may be subject to the post-customs audit, implicitly:\n·        any economic agent that imports or exports goods;\n·        customs brokers;\n·        warehouse administrators;\n·        economic agents that are related to customs procedures;\n·        any economic agent that does not directly carry out import/export operations, but is related, directly or indirectly, to such transactions.\n2. Audit procedure\nThe post-customs audit includes the following basic steps:\nI. Planning the audit. The selection of economic agents proposed to be the object of the audit is carried out on the basis of the risk analysis, as well as other categories of available information. The customs bodies draw up the control plan, which is coordinated with the State Fiscal Service. In case of identification of coincidences in the part that refers to the person subject to the audit, it is mandatory to carry out common controls.\nII. Prior information of the economic agent. The post-clearance audit is carried out on the basis of a control order. About the audit, the audited person is informed in writing at least 3 working days before the date of initiation of the control, except for unannounced control. The control plan is published on the website of the Customs Service and can be accessed at this link https://customs.gov.md/ro/articles/graficul-controalelor. The prior notification is made with the aim of not disrupting the current activity of the economic agent and for it to be able to make available to the audit team an adequate work space, registers and financial-accounting records, other data that are directly related or indirectly with import/export goods, goods storage spaces, ensuring the presence of competent people.\nIII. Performing the audit. The audit period must not exceed 2 months. This term can be extended by a maximum of 4 months in well-founded and documented cases.\nThe audit is carried out by an audit team designated for this purpose and is carried out at the company's headquarters during the working hours of the customs body and the controlled person.\nIf, in the course of the audit, it is necessary to establish certain facts and circumstances based on documents or goods that are in the possession of another person, with whom the audited person has or had economic and/or financial relations, the customs authority is entitled , with the issuance of a new control order, to carry out a cross-check.\nDuring the audit, the following is carried out:\n-                     control of documents (persons carrying out external economic transactions are obliged to keep the documents related to these operations, for the purpose of subsequent control, for a period of 5 years);\n-                     verification of accounting records\n-                     performing cross-checks (when necessary)\n-                     physical verification of goods subject to controlled operations\nIf during the audit process violations of the legislation were found, the customs authority performs, together with the audited person, their examination, draws up a report and informs the audited person about the legal consequences of the respective violations.\nWithin 7 working days from the drawing up of the minutes, the audited person has the right to submit additional information and documents to the customs body in writing.\nThe results of the post-customs audit are stipulated in the Act of post-customs audit, which describes the violations of the legislation and/or the degree of correctness of the calculation and extinguishment of the customs obligation.\nBased on the act, the customs authorities take measures to calculate and collect the customs duties due.\nThe Regularization Decision serves as proof of the appearance of the customs obligation, which constitutes a debt title.\n3. The rights and obligations of the controlled person\nThe controlled person has the right:\na) to request obtaining, during the subsequent control through post-customs audit, information about the established facts and circumstances, in compliance with the legislation in force;\nb) to benefit from a fair and impartial attitude on the part of the customs bodies when carrying out the subsequent control;\nc) to present to the customs body explanations regarding the object of the subsequent control;\nd) to challenge, in the manner established by the legislation, the decisions, actions or inactions of customs bodies and customs collaborators;\ne) to present, in any form, to the customs body information, data, documents that confirm the correctness of the calculation and payment of import duties;\nf) to be informed, at least 3 working days before the initiation of the subsequent control through post-customs audit (with the exception of unannounced post-customs audit), through a post-customs audit notice, the model of which is established by the Customs Service;\ng) to benefit from other rights established by legislation.\nThe controlled person has the following obligations:\na) to keep the accounting and ensure the integrity of the respective documents in accordance with the requirements of the legislation;\nb) to present, at the first request, in the subsequent control process, to the customs collaborators the goods acquired or held, information, data, documents in any form, necessary for verification;\nc) to ensure the customs collaborators, during the conduct of the post-customs audit, free access to the headquarters, production premises, warehouses and other rooms, with the exception of those used exclusively as domicile and residence, for their inspection;\nd) to ensure the integrity of the seals applied by the customs collaborators;\ne) to assist in the performance of the subsequent control, to sign the documents regarding its result and, in case of disagreement, to present, within 15 calendar days at most, the arguments for the disagreement, attaching the necessary documents;\nf) to ensure adequate conditions for carrying out the post-customs audit, to make an office available to customs collaborators, ensuring the necessary assistance;\ng) to ensure the presence of qualified personnel from the audited person in order to help customs collaborators during the post-customs audit.\n \nb) Rechecking the customs declaration\nThe re-verification of the customs declaration is a form of subsequent control, which is carried out at the office of the customs authority and consists in verifying, after the granting of customs clearance, the correctness and completeness of the information provided in a customs declaration, as well as the existence and compliance of the documents supporting documents attached to it, necessary for placing the goods in a customs destination, other documents related to the verified operations at the disposal of the customs authority, another body with fiscal administration powers or other institutions and persons.\n \nRe-verification is carried out according to the result of the risk analysis.\n \nIn case of detection of irregularities or violations of customs/fiscal legislation, upon completion of the reverification of one or more customs declarations, the staff assigned with reverification duties draws up the presentation note, then, after approval, the report of reverification of the customs declarations is drawn up , which is brought to the attention of the customs payer.\nIn the case of detection of errors and/or discrepancies between the information in the customs declarations and those in the verified documents that lead to the appearance, modification and/or cancellation of the customs obligation, the customs authority is obliged to communicate this to the customs payer by drawing up the re-verification report customs declarations.\nIn case of detection of a customs violation that leads to the appearance of a customs obligation and non-fulfillment of the legal requirements of the declarant, the customs authority draws up a regularization decision.\nIn situations where the reverification of customs declarations is carried out on the basis of the documents available to the customs body or received from other authorities or persons, according to the legal provisions, as well as when the signing of the minutes of the reverification of customs declarations is refused or in the event that the person cannot be found, the report is signed only by the customs officer who carried out the reverification of the customs declarations. In these cases, the report of the reverification of the customs declarations will be made known and, respectively, communicated to the person whose declaration/declarations were reverified, by means of registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt.\n \nSection 4. Classifier of customs documents\n\n\n4.1. Types of Customs Declaration\nGoods and means of transport that cross the customs border, goods and means of transport whose customs destination changes, other goods and means of transport in the cases established under the law are declared to the customs body.\nThe declaration is made in writing, verbally or by action, by electronic means or by other methods provided by the legislation.\nThe customs declaration, which is submitted to the customs authority, must be accompanied by all the documents necessary for customs clearance. In the case of submitting the customs declaration in electronic format, all the documents required for customs clearance are submitted in electronic format, with the application of the digital signature on the customs declaration, issued by the Public Key Certification Center of the public administration authorities.\nThe customs body has the right to request additional information to verify the data from the customs declaration or from other documents presented. The list of documents and additional information that must be presented is established by the Customs Service.\nElectronic declaration is accessible to all economic agents and does not require certain authorizations from customs. At the same time, in order to declare electronically, the economic agent or his customs broker must have a digital signature issued by the Special Telecommunications Center.\nThe electronic procedure can be requested for all types of international transport (car, rail, air, postal items) and for all types of goods. Exceptions are only on import for goods transported in groupage (goods transported in a single means of transport and delivered to several recipients) and in the case of international postal items. In these cases, the goods must be presented to the internal customs post.\nSTAGES OF EXPORT CUSTOMS\nStep 1: Registration at the customs office.\nFor the first export operation, the economic agent will register in one of the 3 Customs Offices in the area of activity where the company's headquarters are located.\nAt the customs office, documents of establishment of the economic agent, certificates confirming the bank accounts, samples of the signatures of the persons who have the right to act on behalf of the company, without appropriate powers of attorney, are submitted.\nStep 2: Concluding the contract with the customs broker (if applicable).\nIf the economic agent wants to declare through a customs broker, a contract on customs services must be concluded with one of the companies licensed in the field of customs brokerage. The list of companies with the right to perform this activity can be accessed on the web page http://www.licentiere.gov.md/licenta.php?l=ro, and in the field \"Type of activity\" choose \"39. *Customs broker activity*\".\nWhen selecting the broker, it is important to consider his experience, good reputation, professionalism of specialists, but also the proposed contractual conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to choose a broker who has been active in this field for a long time, has representative offices in several regions of the country and whose experience is confirmed and indisputable.\nIf the exporter prefers to self-declare the goods without engaging the services of a licensed customs broker, then he must go through Step 4 and 5 as follows.\nStep 3: Obtaining access to the Customs Integrated Information System (if applicable).\nAccess to the customs information system is achieved on the basis of access keys issued at the request of the economic agent, which corresponds to the following criteria: to have an adequate IT infrastructure; to use the customs information system connection standards agreed by the Customs Service; to have at least one competent specialist in the field of customs clearance.\nWith the authorization, the person receives from the customs authority the access keys to the IT module for processing the customs declaration in detail.\nStep 4: Obtaining the electronic signature.\nIn order to obtain the electronic signature, interested persons should submit a request to the Customer Support Service of the Special Telecommunications Center. The other types of digital signatures are not accepted by customs. https://www.cts.md/servicii/semnatura-electronica\n\n\n4.2. Transport Documents\nStep 5: Preparing the necessary documents for customs clearance.\nThe declarant must ensure that he has the documents necessary for export, so as to confirm the data indicated in the customs declaration. The minimum set of documents required for customs clearance includes:\n1) commercial document – invoice\n2) transport document\nTransport documents (the official documents that accompany the load and contain information about the conditions and nature of the movement, as well as the basic characteristics of the transported goods).\n⁻ When traveling by car:\n• CMR - the international consignment note stipulated by the International Convention regarding the contract for the carriage of goods by road (Geneva, 12.05.1956);\n• The TIR Carnet provided for by the International Convention on the international transport of cargo under the cover of the TIR Carnet (Geneva, 14.11.1975.);\n⁻ When transporting by air transport – the bill of lading (freight) stipulated by the Convention on the unification of certain rules regarding international air transport (Warsaw city, 12.10.1929.);\n⁻ When traveling by rail – the consignment note stipulated by the International Agreement on the International Carriage of Goods by Rail (entered into force on 01.11.1951);\n⁻ When moving goods by means of naval transport – the bill of lading stipulated by the UN Convention on the Maritime Transport of Cargoes (Hamburg, 1978).\n3) as the case may be, the permissive act.\nTo check whether the export of the goods in question requires the permissive act (license, authorization or certificate), you can access the Comprehensive Customs Tariff of the Republic of Moldova (TARIM), available online on the website of the Customs Service http://customs.gov.md/ro/content/tariful-vamal-integrat-al-republicii-moldova.\nAlthough these documents are sufficient for submitting the declaration, the declarant can also attach other documents that he considers relevant, such as the contract under which the goods are exported, quality certificates, etc.\n\n\n4.3. Other documents confirming the right of Possession, Use and/or Disposal of Goods\nStep 6: Permissive acts for dual-use goods.\nLaw no. 160/2011 regarding the regulation by authorization of entrepreneurial activity /22/ introduces the new List of Permissive Acts issued by the issuing authorities to natural and legal persons for the practice of entrepreneurial activity.\nAnnex I, part II is limited to only 4 Permissive Acts for dual-use goods, issued by the Public Services Agency:\n• Individual authorization to export strategic goods (with dual destination),\n• Individual authorization to import strategic goods (with dual destination),\n• Individual transit authorization of strategic goods (dual destination),\n• Individual authorization for the re-export of strategic goods (dual destination) with annex.\nThe above-mentioned authorizations are issued for the term requested by the economic agent, at the decision of the Commission.\nWhen importing goods included in the Nomenclature of strategic goods subject to control or of goods considered strategic in another state, the Public Services Agency is authorized to issue upon request (article 9, paragraph 6, Law no. 1163/2000) [23]:\n• International import certificate (Appendix 18),\n• End user certificate (Appendix 19),\n• Delivery verification certificate (Appendix 20),\nto be presented to the competent body in the country of destination.\nBy the same Appendix no., I, part II to Law no. 160/2011 legislates 2 types of permissive acts (authorizations) issued by ANRANR (art. 11, paragraph d), Law no. 132/2012):\n• Radiological authorization;\n• Partial radiological authorization.\nAll Radiological Authorizations are issued free of charge, for a period of 5 years.\nHolding the radiological authorization, including the partial import/export one, does not exempt the economic agent from obtaining the individual authorization for strategic or dual-use goods from ASP.\nImplementation procedures of Law no. 160/2011 are approved by HG no. 606/2002 [26] regarding the National Control System for the export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods in the Republic of Moldova.\nThe Government establishes the authorized authority (Interdepartmental Control Commission) with the procedures for evaluating the request for export, import, re-export and transit of strategic goods, which submits a reasoned decision to ASP regarding the issuance or refusal of the requested authorization.\nThe issued authorizations are presented to the SV in original by the exporter/importer.\nStep 7: Completing and submitting the electronic customs declaration, paying the fee for customs procedures.\nThe exporter or customs broker completes the customs declaration in the customs integrated information system and stores it with the scanned copies of the accompanying documents on the customs server, applying the electronic signature.\nThe exporter must ensure the transfer to the customs account of the amount of the tax for customs procedures, which is 0.1% of the value of the goods, taking into account the expenses related to the transport to the border, but not more than 500 euros.\nThe customs integrated information system registers the declaration. In the case of export, within one hour maximum, customs sends an electronic message allowing the goods to be presented at the border post requested by the exporter. Only in case of identification of risks, the customs requires the presentation of the goods at the internal customs post for control (it should be noted that, according to customs data, about 90% of export declarations are selected on the green corridor - without customs control).\nStep 8: Transport to the border customs post.\nWhen the goods are presented at the border customs post, the customs declaration is validated and the export is considered finalized.\nFeatures of customs clearance and control of nuclear/radioactive materials\nThe national rules and regulations regarding the safe conduct of nuclear and radiological activities for exclusively peaceful purposes, in compliance with the obligations arising from the international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, are established by Law no. 132/2012 regarding the safe conduct of nuclear and radiological activities. According to the special provisions of art. 9 of Law no. 132/2012, it is prohibited:\n• import, export, re-export, transit, temporary admission or temporary export of ionizing radiation sources (including part of medical or measuring equipment, calibration) without the appropriate permit issued by the National Agency for Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activities (ANRANR);\n• the import of radioactive waste.\nAt the same time, it is prohibited to import previously used radiological installations or radioactive sources by presenting the declaration on personal responsibility of the legal entity importing the radiological installations or radioactive sources.\nIt is also prohibited to import closed radioactive sources without the obligation to return them after use to the manufacturer. The end user is obliged to provide proof of financial insurance in case of bankruptcy or loss of legal capacity.\nANRANR established that, in order to effectively control the movement of ionizing radiation sources and to prevent their unauthorized circulation on the customs territory of the Republic of Moldova, joint measures are being developed to control the circulation of ionizing radiation sources in accordance with national legislation.\nAccording to article 18 of Law no. 132/2012, the Customs Service controls and admits, exclusively on the basis of ANRANR authorization, the export, re-export, import and temporary admission or temporary export or transit of sources of ionizing radiation, equipment with sources of ionizing radiation, nuclear materials or radioactive, as well as relevant information for the proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\nIn this context, the Customs Services approved Order no. 205-O of 21.05.2012 regarding the response procedures to combat illicit traffic with nuclear and radioactive material, by which the Regulation on Standard Operating Procedures at the scene of the incident was approved.\nAt the same time, when introducing and removing radioactive substances, which are transported under state control, they are subject to the priority order of customs clearance through simplified procedures (Article 138 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova).\nThe transport of nuclear and radioactive materials is regulated by article 40 of Law no. 132/2012, as well as HG no. 434 of 16.07.2015 [36] for the approval of the Regulation on the safe transport of radioactive materials, according to which the transport of nuclear and radioactive materials is carried out exclusively by holders of the appropriate radiological authorization.\nEach transport through the territory of radioactive sources or nuclear materials not exempted from the authorization regime requires obtaining the partial radiological authorization for transport in the established manner.\nIn accordance with the requirements of international legislation, radioactive materials must be transported only in specialized packaging. An exception to these rules is the movement of a limited number of isotopes in exempt packages (UN2908, UN2909, UN2910, UN2911, UN2912 according to the UN dangerous goods numbering). All other radioactive devices/materials are delivered in Type A, Type B (U), Type B (M), Type C packages.\nPackages for the transport of radioactive materials are subject to mandatory certification and to cross the customs border, it is necessary to provide a valid security certificate (Article 4 of Law No. 132/2012). Type B (U), type B (M) or type C packages of foreign manufacture have a certificate of approval of the country of origin.\nWhen concluding a contract for the supply of radioactive materials, it must be respected that their export, re-export, import and transit are carried out in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Moldova on issues related to the control of strategic goods (Law no. 1163/2000 and HG no. 606/2002) and the safe conduct of nuclear and radiological activities (Law no. 132/2012).\n\n\nSection 5. Transportation of strategic and dangerous goods\n\n\n\n\nThe transport of strategic and dangerous goods involves risks and must be carried out in a safe and secure manner to prevent accidental exposure or their use for malicious purposes. Here are some important aspects to consider regarding the transportation of strategic and dangerous goods. These categories also include CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear) goods.\n\n\n1. Regulations and Rules: There are strict international and national regulations and rules governing the transportation of CBRN materials. These include requirements relating to packaging, labelling, documentation, exposure protection and general transport security. It is essential to comply with these regulations and follow established procedures.\n2. Specialized packaging: CBRN materials must be packed in special containers and properly sealed to prevent leakage or accidental release. These may include strong, watertight and sealed containers to protect the contents from external factors and movement.\n3. Labeling and identification: CBRN materials must be properly labeled to indicate their nature and hazard. Labels should contain information about the substance, hazard level, handling instructions and other specific warnings. This facilitates the proper identification and handling of CBRN materials by specialized personnel.\n4. Routes and planning: Transportation of CBRN materials should be carefully planned, considering safe routes and avoiding populated areas, sensitive areas or high accident risk areas. Proper route planning and coordination with relevant authorities can help minimize risks.\n5. Security and protection: Transportation of CBRN materials must be accompanied by adequate security and protection measures. These may include security escorts, video surveillance, alarm systems, checks and strict access controls. Personnel involved in transport should be properly trained and aware of security procedures.\n6. Cooperation and Communication: Effective communication and cooperation between all parties involved in the transportation of CBRN material is vital. This includes collaboration between carriers, responsible authorities, law enforcement and other relevant entities to ensure effective coordination and rapid exchange of information when necessary.\n\n\nIt is important to pay special attention to the transport of CBRN materials and take all necessary measures to minimize risks and ensure safe and secure transport of these sensitive materials.\n\n\n\n\nSection 6. Risk management system in relation to goods subject to customs clearance\n\n\nThe Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova has an important role in the regulation of foreign economic activity. The basic mission consists in promoting the customs policy in order to ensure the economic security of the state, by facilitating and streamlining trade, securing the international traffic of goods and means of transport, in ensuring compliance with customs regulations, collecting import and export rights, in the fight against fraud customs, in the development of a professional and transparent administration, which implements international standards in order to simplify customs procedures and protects society by uniformly and impartially applying customs legislation. In order to achieve the established objectives, one of its basic duties is to ensure the control of goods, means of transport and other goods moved across the customs border of the Republic of Moldova, in order to ensure the economic security of the state and counter cross-border fraud. In order to manage the ever-increasing commercial volume that is currently due to the Russian aggression on the neighboring state of Ukraine, a rapid strategy based on selectivity through risk management is necessary. The harmonization of the Customs Code with the standards of the European Union, the development of foreign trade relations, the complexity of the tasks facing the Customs Service, the globalization of the economy, the possibility of applying modern information technologies conditioned the revision of the procedures and rules for carrying out customs control, according to European requirements and standards , and the development of new strategies in the targeted field, emerging from the risk assessment system.\nAll customs laws and regulations are aimed at ensuring the collection of customs duty payments, compliance with restrictions and prohibitions, and the application of special rules regarding quotas, preferential treatment and other trade policy measures. For each of these there is a corresponding risk that it will be violated by economic agents intentionally or involuntarily.\nRisk management techniques attempt to identify and quantify these risks in order to be able to develop control procedures such as selection for documentary or physical control and to allow customs officials to focus their control efforts on those areas of risk where it is a breach of customs regulations is most likely to occur.\nWhen performing the customs control, the customs bodies will be guided by the principle of selectivity and, as a rule, will limit themselves to forms of control sufficient to ensure compliance with the customs legislation of the Republic of Moldova. The forms of customs control are to be selected by applying the risk management system. To carry out an analysis of the risk management system, it is necessary to define the concept of risk management and highlight the benefits of using this system by the customs authorities. Therefore, risk management is the method that aims to select those transactions where violations of customs legislation usually occur or are most likely to occur and to direct the resources available to customs to these targets.\nThe benefits of using risk management are:\n·        Economic benefits by facilitating the movement of goods when the identified risk is low.\n·        Effective use of skills and experience to generate the highest possible results.\n·        Better quality of information and accountability customs controls.\nRisk management is also a trade facilitation measure through which economic agents that comply with customs regulations can clear their goods without being subject to rigorous documentary and physical controls carried out by customs officials. The creation of a modern risk management system ensures the performance of an adequate customs control, based on the optimal redistribution of the resources of the Customs Service on the most important and priority directions of the activity of the customs bodies in order to prevent and combat the following violations of the customs legislation of the Republic of Moldova:\n·        systematic;\n·        related to evading the payment of import/export duties and other considerable taxes;\n·        which undermines the competitiveness of domestic producers' production;\n·        which harm other important interests of the state, the protection and respect of which is the responsibility of the customs bodies.\nThe implementation of risk management activities in the customs system of the Republic of Moldova began in 2005 by establishing the operating principles of risk management included in the Concept of the risk management system in the Customs Service, approved by Government Decision No. 1144 of 03.11.2005, as and in the internal normative acts of the Customs Service and the methodological documents developed according to international standards in the field, such as: Guide to the risk analysis activity; Load selectivity guide; Cargo selectivity management regulation; Cargo Examination Guidance Manual.\nThe risk management system is carried out by the Risk Analysis Directorate, which is a structural subdivision of the Anti-Fraud and Compliance Department within the Central Apparatus of the Customs Service, and at the level of customs offices - by the Risk Analysis Sections/Sectors. Analytical activity is carried out at national (central apparatus) and local (customs offices and customs posts), each level having the responsibility to ensure the collection, storage, updating and processing of information in order to establish the causes and conditions of the occurrence of risks, their identification and the implementation of actions neutralizing them. The risk analysis and management function represented by each subdivision must have access to the various sources of internal and external data and information relevant to the activity of preventing and discovering customs fraud in general. The place of a risk management process in the Customs Service is hatched in the figure below:\nAs sources that can be used are:\n• internal sources of the customs authorities regarding the operational environment, regardless of the form (electronic support or paper) that can help the risk analysis activity;\n• public - departmental sources, institutions with duties to ensure compliance with the law such as:\n1. The Intelligence and Security Service - regarding smuggling of weapons, ammunition, combat equipment, explosive, radioactive, poisonous, narcotic, toxic and other substances;\n2. Ministry of Internal Affairs - regarding illegal drug trafficking, car theft, weapons, ammunition and other criminal activities;\n3. Ministry of Defense - regarding the proliferation of weapons and the passage of military personnel across the state border;\n4. Ministry of Health - regarding medicinal products allowed for import, dangerous products, the database regarding the epidemiological situation in the countries of the world, counterfeit products, etc.;\n5. Ministry of Economy - regarding the application of anti-dumping measures, the administration of quotas and quotas granted on the basis of free trade agreements to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, the trend of increase/decrease in the import/export of some goods based on the analysis of trade between the Republic of Moldova and other countries, the sales prices of goods on the domestic market, of dual-use goods and of strategic goods;\n6. National Agency for Food Safety (ANSA) - regarding the veterinary and phytosanitary certificates issued for the import/export of products, the lists of economic agents who were denied the issuance of certificates, the issuance of authorizations for the import of planting material, seeds and breeding animals;\n7. The Ministry of Culture - regarding the illegal circulation and crimes whose object is mobile cultural values regarding the database of stolen mobile cultural values and authorizations for the export/import of mobile cultural values;\nInternational sources - the use of different sources of international data, reports or analyses, such as the systems and mechanisms for the exchange of data and information managed by:\n1. World Customs Organization (exchange of information on customs fraud detected through the CEN database);\n2. SECI regional center for combating cross-border crimes (Bucharest, Romania);\n3. The regional office for the exchange of information in Eastern and Central Europe (RILO-Warsaw);\n4. The European Union Border Assistance Mission in the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM).\n5. In order to detect and prevent fraud of an evasive nature, the European Commission established within its own institution by Decision 1999/352 of April 28, 1999, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). The office was invested with the responsibility of leading anti-fraud investigations, benefiting from a special status as well as others such as Europol, Interpol, etc.\nOther sources of data and information relevant to the prevention and detection of customs fraud, for example the Internet, mass media, other public sources.\nWhat are the basic duties of the Risk Analysis Directorate:\n1. Management of the selectivity system of SI \"ASYCUDA World\".\n2. Profiling, assessment and management of determined and potential risks.\n3. Collaboration with national/international institutions in the field of risk management.\n4. Development of the risk management system. Therefore, structurally\n \nThe direction is made up of 2 sections:\n\n\nThe department of risk analysis in the application of the risk management system (S.A.R.) includes several stages, such as identification, analysis, assessment of risks and monitoring of applied measures. An integral part of S.A.R. is the development of selectivity criteria and risk profiles. The selectivity criteria are elaborated on the basis of risk indicators, the determinants being: the code of the goods, the country of origin, the country of destination, licensing, value, importer/exporter, type of transport, the purpose of the goods being in the customs territory, the financial consequences or the financial situation of the economic agent/natural person, etc. The risk profiles contain the descriptions of the risk areas, the risk assessment, the measures that need to be taken to prevent/reduce the risks, the term of application of the risk criterion, the results and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the application of the risk criteria.\nThe selectivity system is based on the existence of some filters that distribute the customs declaration (based on a string of determinants) on one of the 4 selectivity corridors:\nred (mandatory documentary and physical control);\nyellow (mandatory documentary control);\nblue (customs clearance of cargo is carried out without the application of documentary and physical control but with the possibility of subsequent verification);\ngreen (customs clearance of cargo is carried out without the application of control documentary and physical) duty free.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, in the selectivity system, there are hundreds of risk criteria established depending on the commodity code, the country of origin, the country of destination, the type of transport, the purpose of the goods being in the customs territory, the economic agent, etc. The number of risk criteria is not a constant figure, as they are reviewed and updated as necessary. Due to the risk criteria, the selectivity parameters were revised in \"SI ASYCUDA World\" currently used by the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova and which ensures the distribution of customs declarations on one of the control lanes described above depending on the level of risk. The identification of risk factors and their minimization is obtained through the daily analysis of the customs declarations in \"SI ASYCUDA World\", of the daily, quarterly and annual reports received as a result of the activity of the specialized sections, through the participation of the officials of the risk analysis sector in the physical controls and the activity within mixed teams. In order to identify actions to prevent risk factors, customs offices continuously update the list of credible economic agents and the list of economic agents that have committed customs fraud. In November 2009, the new version of \"SI ASYCUDA World\" was launched, which ensures the automated processing of all customs documents. The updated version of the system ensures the implementation of the new simplified customs clearance procedures; automation of the information exchange process with the control services according to the \"single window\" principle; implementing the Integrated Customs Tariff of the Republic of Moldova (TARIM) and optimizing the application of the principle of selectivity when performing customs control.\nThe figure above represents a risk management process in the Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova\n\n\nThe present methodology has a general nature of applicability at the national level and represents a unitary work tool at the level of the central and local Apparatus at the level of offices and customs posts. The purpose of the methodology is to improve the risk management process, by going through the basic stages:\n·        identification,\n·        assessment,\n·        management\n·        risk monitoring.\nTo better understand the description of the methodology, first of all we must define the notion of risk management, risk after and the basic stages:\nRisk management - The process aimed at the identification, evaluation, management including treatment and establishment of a risk mitigation plan, periodic review, monitoring and establishment of responsibilities.\nRisk - is a situation, an event, which has not yet occurred, but which may occur in the future, in which case, the achievement of previously fixed results is threatened or potential. Thus, risk can represent either a threat or an opportunity and must be approached as a combination of probability and impact.\nRisk identification - is the first step in the risk management activity.\nRisk assessment - Assessment of the impact of the materialization of the risk, in combination with the assessment of the probability of the materialization of the risk. Risk assessment is the value of risk exposure.\nRisk management - The measures taken to reduce the probability of the possibility of the risk occurring or/and to reduce the consequences of the impact on the results of the objectives, should the risk materialize. Risk management means reducing exposure to risk, if it is a threat.\nRisk monitoring - It is a type of risk response characterized by the acceptance of the risk with the obligation to monitor it permanently, especially to monitor the probability of the occurrence of the risk.\n\n\n1. Identification of Risks\nRisk management involves the identification and evaluation of risks, the identification and establishment of the response to the risk in order to reduce the possibility of defense of the risks, as well as the reduction of the consequences produced, as a result of the materialization of the risks. Identifying the objectives and activities related to their achievement in the risk identification process, the objectives and activities that contribute to their achievement are always considered. For a proper identification of risks, it is absolutely necessary to have a document that contains the objectives assumed at the entity level. This can be a management plan, an institutional strategic plan or another document that includes: general objectives, specific objectives, activities that contribute to achieving the objectives.\n The central apparatus prepares internal documents for them and those at the level of customs offices to go through the following stages, namely the establishment of general and specific objectives:\n• The general objectives are transposed into specific objectives, to which a series of expected results and indicators are associated and communicated to those in charge.\n• The specific objectives must be defined in such a way that they meet the package of SMART requirements (S - specific, M - measurable, A - adequate, R - realistic, T - have a deadline). For a good management of risks at all managerial levels, the managers of the departments at the first level of management designate those responsible for the risks. They identify and collect the risks related to the objectives and/or activities assumed by the head of the department and monitor the risk management implementation process. The risk identification process is the first step in the risk management activity. It aims to discover all possible sources of risk, with the aim of eliminating or reducing the probability and effects/impact they can produce.\nRisk identification can be in one of two phases:\n·        Risk identification in the initial phase - specific to newly established customs entities or subdivisions, without a history of risk management or without a very well developed risk management. The same situation occurs in the case of starting new projects or new activities in the reorganization process.\n·        Permanent identification of risks - specific to entities that have developed a coherent and consolidated system of internal managerial control and implicit risk management.\nEffective risk management assumes that risk identification is a permanent process, which allows the Customs Service to be connected to the process of change and adaptation. An effective risk management process at the level of the Customs Service must also take into account the priorities of subordinate institutions that contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Customs Service.\nThe main factors that can influence the external risk environment and that the Customs Service must take into account are:\n·        Laws and regulations – The customs service must permanently identify those laws and regulations, based on which it operates and which define the limits of the entity's action;\n·        Modifying / updating the objectives of the government program - in some situations, the handling of some risks by the leaders of the Customs Service is influenced by political decisions;\n·        Sometimes, the reduction of the budget that affects the attraction / maintenance / facilitation of professional training courses for the staff of the Customs Service.\nIn the risk identification process, it is the completion of the Risk Alert Act/Form. The risk alert form is used by customs officials, according to an internal procedure and according to the accumulated experience in risk management. The risk alert form contains: the name of the compartment in which the risk was identified, the details of the risk, the description of the identified risk, the specific objective to which the risk is attached, the causes, the consequences, the assessment of the risk, the estimation of the probability of occurrence, the estimation of the impact, the assessment of the exposure to risk, the person who identifies the risk, the date of drawing up the form, the manager of the department, etc.\nThe risk alert form is completed, checked and endorsed as follows:\n·        Completing the description of the risk, its assessment, recommending control measures and specifying the documentation used to substantiate the identified risk - by the person who identifies a risk, providing in this sense a preliminary assessment of the risk based on two indicators: the probability of the materialization of the risk and its impact.\n·        Expressing a risk opinion on the risk assessment and on the type of risk response and control measures, as appropriate – by the risk manager;\n·        The final decision to rank, escalate or retain the risk for management and approval of the Risk Alert Form - by the head of the department.\n\n\n2. Risk assessment\nThe risk assessment is carried out following a type of response to the risk in an order of priorities and represents the stage following the identification of the risks. The risk assessment consists of:\n·        Estimation of the probability of materialization of risks;\n·        Estimation of the impact on the objectives/activities in case of materialization of risks;\n·        Risk exposure assessment - combination of probability and impact.\nThe risk assessment must:\n·        is based on the use of an evaluation scale;\n·        consider all those affected by the risk;\n·        distinguish between risk exposure and risk tolerance.\nThe purpose of the risk assessment consists in: establishing a hierarchy of the identified risks and depending on the risk tolerance, establishing the most appropriate risk treatment measures. A risk analysis cannot completely eliminate the risk of the decision, but it can give the management of the Customs Service the ability to decide whether or not the risk is acceptable, know the consequences of the decision, both positive and negative, and reduce the risks through control measures. Estimating the probability of the materialization of the risk involves the determination or assessment of a probability / uncertainty. A possible method of estimating the probability of the materialization of the risk is to take into account the frequency of the materialization of some risks in the past. As an evaluation tool, probability scales can be used. The values of these scales are generated by the experience of those who work in Risk Management at the level of the Central Apparatus of the Customs Service. Thus, several types of scales can be used to estimate the probability of a risk materializing:\n\n\n\n\nThe probability thresholds reflect the perception of the Customs Service on the uncertainty with which the identified risks can be associated. For some risks, a qualitative estimate is required, for others, a quantitative estimate is required. It is advisable to use the 5-step evaluation scale only if the Customs Service has accumulated sufficient experience in risk management.\n\n\n3. Risk management\nFor the effective management of the Risk Management process, at the level of the Customs Service it is necessary to have:\n·        Structure with attributions in Risk Management;\n·        Responsible for risk management at the level of each department from the first management level within the Customs Service (Risk Manager) up to and including the customs office level;\n·        Risk Management system procedure. The system procedure must establish a general unitary framework for identifying, evaluating and managing risks at the level of the Customs Authorities.\nIdentifying, establishing and implementing the type of risk response. Risk tolerance is defined within the risk response type. Risk tolerance represents the amount of risk that the Customs Authority is prepared to tolerate or to which it is willing to expose itself at a given time in situations where the risk may be an opportunity or a threat. In this case, risk tolerance has a dual value. Example, the fluctuation of the entity's staff within the percentage limit of 10% - can be beneficial to the entity, representing an opportunity to \"rejuvenate\" the staff; if, however, the personnel turnover exceeds this limit, we can speak of a threat in the conditions where the entity can no longer retain qualified personnel, which can lead to the weakening of the Customs Service and therefore to the weakening of state security.\nThe risk profile provides an overview, including the general, documented and prioritized assessment of the range of specific risks faced by the customs entity. The risk profile is interpreted as follows:\n·        The risks located in the red area have the highest risk exposure and deviation from the risk tolerance and they demand, with priority, the initiation of control measures.\n·        The risks located in the yellow zone have an exposure that exceeds the risk tolerance limit, but the deviation from it is moderate. These risks can be treated by control measures or monitored, depending on the decision of the management of the Customs Service.\n·        The risks located in the green zone are those characterized by an exposure below the risk tolerance limit and in this zone are the assumed risks.\nThe basic tool in Risk Management is the Risk Register. The development of the Risk Register confirms that there is a functional risk monitoring system at the level of the Customs Authority.\nfter the risks have been identified and evaluated and after the tolerance limit has been defined, the type of risk response is determined for each individual risk. In this sense, it is analyzed whether or not the risks can be kept under control. Alternative strategies can be identified in risk management. Customs management can adopt only one type of risk response, depending on the risk tolerance limit.\nTypes of risk response applicable in Risk Management are:\na. Risk acceptance/tolerance. It is a type of risk response defined by not initiating risk control measures, suitable for inherent risks that have an exposure lower than the tolerance limit. Acceptance is applied when the risks identified at compartment level are assumed by the people with decision-making functions or when no other type of response to the risk is possible.\nb. Risk avoidance - is a strategy applied mainly for general support activities, if there is no other way to manage risks.\nc. Risk transfer/outsourcing - this strategy involves entrusting risk management to a third party capable or specialized in managing such risks, as a rule, based on a collaboration memorandum. The outsourcing of risks to another state authority with more specific attributions than customs aims to reduce the risk exposure of the entity but also to better manage the transferred risk.\nd. Risk treatment/management - This type of risk response involves taking control measures for inherent risks that have an exposure greater than the tolerance limit. In order to manage the risks, the risks with high red color exposure will be taken into account, and depending on the management's decision by approving the tolerance limit and the medium yellow risks above the tolerance limit. Average risks located below the tolerance limit will be monitored at the compartment level.\n\n\n4. Monitoring the implementation of control measures\nControl measures regarding risk management must ensure an acceptable level of risks, so that they are within the accepted tolerance limit.\nAt the level of the Customs Service, the process of monitoring the implementation of control measures is carried out on the basis of a plan. Thus, the Technical Secretariat of the Monitoring Commission receives information, control measures from those responsible for risks for the elaboration of the Plan for the implementation of control measures. The control measures implementation plan includes: the name of the risk, the control measures, the implementation deadlines, the people responsible for the implementation of the control measures.\nRisk review and reporting is the final step that concludes the Risk Management process. The causes underlying the risk review are the following: Major changes that may occur in the institutional environment as well as in the business environment; Modification of risk profiles, as a result of the implementation of control measures and the change of the causes favoring the emergence of risks; the effectiveness of risk management and taking new measures, depending on the case.\nIn the review process, situations are analyzed in which: the risks persist; new risks have been identified, the impact and probability of risks have undergone changes; the implemented internal control tools are effective; certain risks must be managed at another level of management and others. The risk review must provide assurances regarding the evaluation of the risk management process at least once a year and tools for alerting hierarchically higher levels regarding newly identified risks or changes to existing risks, so that these changes are managed. Annual risk reporting is carried out on two levels, at the level of the Central Apparatus of the Customs Service and at the level of customs offices.\nIn conclusion, it should be mentioned that risk management is largely a trade facilitation measure because it allows law-abiding economic agents to clear their goods through fewer documentary and physical checks by customs officials. Risk management provides an opportunity for customs administrations to make objective selections and allows faster customs clearance of goods, thus leading to a consolidation of the national economy and an improvement of the economic status of the country's citizens.\nhttps://customs.gov.md/ro/articles/graficul-controalelor\n\n\nThe UNODC-OMV Container Control Program (PCC) was established as a joint initiative of UNODC and OMV in 2004. Faced with such a complex and globalized problem, the PCC takes a nuanced, holistic and multi-sectoral approach, providing continuous monitoring and surveillance, offering a multitude of context-specific training programs and strengthening cooperation between state agencies and the private sector. The mission of the CPC is to strengthen the capacity of Member States that wish to improve risk management, supply chain security and trade facilitation at seaports, airports and land border crossings to prevent the cross-border movement of illicit goods.\nCPC is currently operational in over 70-member states. More than 120 Port Control Units (PCUs) and Air Cargo Control Units (ACCUs) have been established since the establishment of the PCC in 2004. These inter-agency units are equipped to exchange information with their counterparts in other countries using a secure communication application developed by OMV called Container Comm. This gives PCUs and ACCUs access to a wealth of information, allowing users to share information about high-risk containers and verify their ID numbers.\nBelow is presented some figures with demonstrative examples regarding the numbers and their identification signs:\n\n\nFigure 1 Coding, identification and marking of freight containers, front side\nFigure 2 Codification, identification and marking of cargo containers, rear side\n\n\nFigure 3 Coding, identification and marking of cargo containers, side\nFigure 4 Coding, identification and marking of cargo containers, top/roof\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese efforts resulted in the seizure of a wide range of prohibited goods such as arms and ammunition, fishery products, wildlife and other environmental crimes, prohibited drugs, strategic goods, counterfeit or unlicensed drugs, drug precursors and explosives, cigarettes, alcohol, stolen vehicles and goods that are counterfeit or otherwise infringe intellectual property law. PCC remains ideally positioned to support the strengthening of international supply chain security by strengthening the capabilities of national border administrations to address threats related to sea, land and air freight.\nKey Activities \nEstablish and train Port Control Units (PCUs) and Air Cargo Control Units (ACCUs) composed of Customs, National Police, anti-narcotics forces and other law enforcement agencies to identify and inspect high-risk, disruptive shipments minimums of legitimate trade.\nConduct technical needs assessments of selected seaports, airports and land border crossings to assess the current situation and provide recommendations for future activities, including technical equipment and training needs.\nDesign and delivery of basic training, work-study tours, regional exchange visits, advanced specialized training and mentoring services. Organizing regional meetings and conferences to build capacity and promote an international coordination and cooperative response to crime in the containerized supply chain.\n\n\nEncouraging PCUs and ACCUs to create partnerships and linkages with each other and with the private sector. Promoting closer cooperation and developing effective information and intelligence sharing mechanisms between law enforcement agencies around the world. A very important role is the promotion of women in PCUs and ACCUs to increase their role and influence in these units and in the wider law enforcement community.\nMaintaining a global network of seaports, airports and land border crossings to effectively combat illicit cross-border trade.\nSpecialized Training - PCC offers a core curriculum of theoretical, practical and advanced specialist training, followed by regular mentoring. The first phase is theoretical training, during which officers are introduced to risk analysis, profiling and targeting techniques. The knowledge gained in theoretical training is then operationalized in practical training, which includes the application of profiling and inspection techniques in a professional environment. After the first two phases of formal training, PCU and ACCU officers conduct work study tours to observe best practice techniques and methods in benchmarking ports. To complement basic training, the Program offers advanced specialized training programs depending on country risk assessments and availability of funds. These programs cover a range of topics. The immediate beneficiaries of these programs are the relevant law enforcement agencies, whose personnel will be better structured, trained and equipped to more effectively target high-risk shipping containers. These measures also directly benefit legitimate trade by improving supply chain security and improving efficiency by minimizing unnecessary checks on low-risk containers.\nA significant role for the PCC continues to prioritize the continued development of private sector partnerships. Cooperation between the private and public sectors improves competitive advantage, reduces costs and reduces operational risks for businesses. The PCC is ideally suited to support countries and regions in the implementation of United Nations instruments, resolutions and Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe United Nations Container Control Program instruments strive to facilitate the implementation of all United Nations Security Council resolutions related to the program's activities. The CCP has evolved over time and expanded into new thematic areas in accordance with various UN Security Council resolutions on emerging threats, including trafficking in cultural property (UNSCR 2199, 2322, 2347), CBRN materials, weapons and their means of delivery (UNSCR 1540), small arms and light weapons (UNSCR 2220), as well as the operation of the supply chain of goods intended for air transport (UNSCR 2309) and the situation in Afghanistan (UNSCR 1267 and 1988).\nAs the global economy becomes increasingly interconnected, business opportunities have spread throughout the world. Shipping lanes are the highways of international trade; more than 750 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) movements are recorded, accounting for 90% of global freight trade. However, this presents opportunities not only for governments and legitimate businesses, but also for terrorists and transnational organized crime groups to transport everything from legal goods used for money laundering, to illicit drugs and even materials for weapons of destruction in mass. These actors benefit from the large volume of global trade, as this makes it extremely difficult to effectively monitor less than two percent of shipping containers are ever checked.\nMoreover, the rise of darknet technologies has allowed anyone to access crypto-markets that exploit standard postal and commercial shipping services. Finally, the challenge is compounded by the proliferation of sophisticated concealment measures, corruption, limited resources, complex and diverse port processes and systems, and a lack of trust and coordination between state agencies and private sector actors. Thus, this situation poses serious dangers to international security and the supply chain of international trade, which is vital for sustainable development.\n\"If the enemies of progress and human rights seek to exploit the openness and opportunities of globalization for their own purposes, then we must exploit the same factors to defend human rights and defeat the forces of crime, corruption and human trafficking.\"\n\n\nThe Customs Service continues the implementation of new programs in the Republic of Moldova, and here we cannot overlook the Container Control Program of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). This Program is implemented based on the Memorandum signed at the end of 2014, between the Customs Service, the Border Police of the Republic of Moldova and UNODC. This program aims to strengthen the capacities of law enforcement bodies, in order to secure the traffic of containers, to prevent fundamental crimes. For the year 2015, UNODC representatives together with the signatory authorities started the practical implementation stage of the Program, UNODC representatives visited Giurgiulești Port, where concrete actions were initiated according to the approved Plan. Thus, according to the Plan, a Joint Control Unit was created at Giurgiulești Port, made up of customs officials and border police officers. This unit was granted access to specialized information programs (ContainerComm, Cargo Targeting System) with container databases and risk analysis systems. These IT systems ensure the identification of containers with increased risk of fraud and the exchange of operational information between law enforcement bodies in order to coordinate actions at national and regional level. In this sense, training courses are held for responsible persons. At the same time, the Joint Control Unit was equipped with special control equipment, intended to detect and prevent the illicit trafficking of goods and drugs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Container Control Program was developed by the World Customs Organization and UNODC and is implemented with the extension of this program for Moldova, which is of particular importance in the context of the development of the Giurgiulesti International Free Port and the increase in the number of import, export and transit operations of goods in containers.\nIn 2018, the management of the Customs Service requested to increase the efficiency of container control by expanding the collaboration between it and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) within the Container Control Program, the regional coordinator of UNODC, Naida Chamilova. The Customs Service of Moldova refers to the expansion of the competence area of the joint intervention group, specialized in the control of containers. Currently, the established group operates only in Giurgiulesti PIL, but the institution is examining the opportunity of locating it in Chisinau and conferring the powers to control containers throughout the country, an ongoing action.\nThe program aims to optimize the preventive actions carried out in the Republic of Moldova regarding containers transported by sea and legal land in order to reduce the risk of their use in illicit activities, especially illicit drug trafficking, chemical precursors, smuggling of goods, tax evasion and potential terrorist acts.\n\n\nSection 7. Interaction of the Customs Service with the authorities, agencies and stakeholders\nGeneral\nThe Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova is the national authority responsible for border control of strategic/dual-use goods.\nThe Customs Service of the Republic of Moldova controls the movement of controlled goods across the customs border and admits, exclusively on the basis of authorizations in the field of export control, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods, and is the authorized body for the implementation of the national legislation and the fulfillment of the international obligations of the Republic of Moldova. The legal basis of the customs activity to which these responsibilities are implied is the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova.[8]\nAt the same time, it should be mentioned that the customs service in its field has signed protocol agreements and other understandings with various partners and countries for more intense cooperation.[9]\n\n\n[8] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136158&lang=ro#\n[9] https://customs.gov.md/ro/articles/cooperare-vamala-internationala\n\n\n7.1. Inter-Agency Cooperation\nInterdepartmental commission\nConsidering the subject of the handbook one of the main cooperation in the segment of strategic control is the cooperation between the related institutions that are directly related to this matter. In this sense, as previously mentioned the Government Decision no. 606/2002, which establishes the Regulation of the interdepartmental control commission on the export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods, is formed from members from the following institutions:\n\n\n\n\nEach member of this commission has its own role, depending on the functions of the institution he or she represents. Inter-institutional communication here is intended to prevent, control and verify potentially dangerous transactions and to mitigate the risks of diversion both in export and import.\n\n\nThe functions of the commission are:\n•        examination of proposals regarding the signing or accession to interstate and intergovernmental agreements (at bilateral and multilateral level) in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other strategic goods;\n•        carrying out control over compliance with the commitments assumed within the framework of interstate and intergovernmental agreements on non-proliferation and control over the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction and other strategic goods;\n•        examining and making decisions regarding the issuance of authorizations for export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods on the territory of the Republic of Moldova;\n•        making decisions regarding the suspension or cancellation of the authorization for the export, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods in the event that the economic agent holding the authorization violated the provisions of the legislation in force in the respective field or arising from international commitments and state policy in the field of goods traffic control strategic.\nThe commission set up working groups with the participation of experts from other ministries and institutions to examine and prepare proposals for resolving issues related to the legal regulation of export control, re-export, import and transit of strategic goods.\nAgency of Public Services (APS)\nIn order to obtain the individual authorization for export, re-export, import or transit of strategic goods, the applicant applies, on paper, in electronic format or through the single electronic counter for requesting permissive documents, to the body authorized by the Government (APS), containing the applicant's identification data and to which the necessary documents are attached.\nThe APS examines the application and the documents attached to it and forwards them to the Interdepartmental Commission for examination and making the appropriate decisions. In accordance with the decisions of the Commission, the APS will issue or refuse to issue the authorization for the export, re-export, import or transit of strategic goods and will notify the applicant of this authorization about the decision taken within 30 calendar days.\nThe term of validity of each export, re-export, import or transit authorization of strategic goods is determined by the interdepartmental Commission, based on the information presented by the applicant. (See in the annexes the samples of the authorizations and related documents)\n\n\nNational Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activities (NARNRA)\nLaw no. 132/2012 on the Safe Development of Nuclear and Radiological Activities, the provisions of Article 3, applies to import, export, re-export and temporary admission or temporary export of sources of ionizing radiation, including nuclear material, nuclear fuel, and radioactive waste.\nArticle 4 of the Law defines:\n·        radiological authorization - permissive act issued for activities not exempted by the authorization regime because of the assessment of compliance and observance of the conditions of nuclear and /or radiological activities;\n·        partial radiological authorization - radiological authorization issued for a phase of nuclear or radiological activity in the established field and within the time interval.\nArticle 19 (c), d) of the Law establishes the authorization regime in the nuclear and radiological field and also refers to the import/export, temporary admission or temporary export of sources of ionizing radiation and radioactive sources.\nAccording to the nor\n\n\nmative acts, the applicant submits to NARNRA a request according to the model (Annex 6) and a file containing the necessary documents according to the type of activity (Annex 7). In accordance with the article 9 of the Law 1163/2000 the Customs Service allows import, export, re-export or transit of such goods on presentation of original authorizations (Annexes 13 - 20) issued by APS and accompanied by respective Radiological Authorization (Annex 9).\nArticle 18 of the Law no.132/2012 provides for the Customs Service to carry out the control, which allows the export, re-export, import and temporary admission or temporary export or transit of sources of ionizing radiation, equipment with ionizing radiation sources, nuclear or radioactive materials, as well as information pertinent to proliferation of nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices, only at the presentation of the NARNRA authorization. Government Decision no.727/2014 regulates the authorization of the nuclear and radiological activities, for import, export, re-exports and transit operations on the authorization of nuclear and radiological activities.\n \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration\nThrough the communication and support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, a list of actions is being undertaken. For instance, they are informing the customs of the current sanctions’ regimes of the UN Security Council,[10] that can be introduced (if its case) in the risk profiles. At the same time, they are the authority through it is promoted, negotiated or supported various initiatives for disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.[11]\nThe European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM)[12]\nThe EUBAM mission works in the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine to:\n·        Promote European Union border management standards and procedures for a quicker crossing of people and goods;\n·        Enhance the professional capacities of the Moldovan and Ukrainian Customs and Border Authorities;\n·        Assist Moldovan and Ukrainian authorities in combating cross-border crime more efficiently;\n·        Act as a catalyst and bring together key stakeholders to strengthen cross-border cooperation between the border authorities and law enforcement agencies;\n·        Contribute to the peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict.\nVarious agreements and cooperation with national institutions such as: Border Police, Public Services Agency, National Agency for Food Safety, State Tax Service, National Auto Transport Agency, Intelligence and Security Service, General Prosecutor's Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Economic Development and Digitization, National Bureau of Statistics.[13]\n\n\n[10] https://mfa.gov.md/ro/content/masuri-restrictive-internationale\n[11] https://mfa.gov.md/ro/content/neproliferarea-armelor-de-distrugere-masa\n[12] https://eubam.org/ro/\n[13] https://customs.gov.md/ro/articles/cooperare-interinstitutionala\n\n\n\n\nThe aim of the strategic trade control enforcement should be consisted of the following pylons:\n\n\n7.2. Relationship of the customs authority with the stakeholders\na.     Applicant and Customs representatives\nThe customs code defines the following:\nDeclarant – any person who has the right to dispose of goods and/or means of transport, who draws up the customs declaration in his name or in whose name the customs declaration is drawn up;\nDirect representation – the report in which the customs broker acts in the name and on the account of another person;\nIndirect representation – the report in which the customs broker acts in his own name, but on the account of another person;\nA customs broker is a legal person, registered in accordance with the legislation, who holds a license for the activity of a customs broker, issued by the licensing body, and who, on the principles of direct or indirect representation, declares the goods, presents them for customs clearance, and performs other customs operations. For the customs obligation incurred, the customs broker is jointly and severally liable with the customs payer.\nThe relations between the customs broker and the person he represents are established on the basis of a contract, concluded in compliance with the requirements of the legislation in force, which shall provide, mandatorily, the type of representation. The mentioned contract is presented to the customs authorities at their request and justifies the powers of the customs broker to represent the declarant.\nAll goods that cross the customs border are subject to declaration by completing and submitting a detailed customs declaration by the representative in relations with the Customs Service.\nb.     Customs carrier\nIn accordance with the customs, code of Moldova the Customs carrier is defined - the person who de facto passes the goods across the customs border or who is responsible for using the means of transport.\nWhen introducing goods and means of transport into the customs territory, the carrier notifies the customs authority about crossing the customs border. The customs body registers this notice and determines the time and place where the goods and means of transport must be brought to be cleared by customs.\nAbout the removal of goods and means of transport from the Republic of Moldova, the person passing them informs the customs body in advance. It registers the notification and determines the time and place where the goods and means of transport must be brought to be cleared. If the person who passes the goods and the means of transport across the customs border does not notify the customs body, this obligation rests with the carrier.\nThe provisions of this article do not apply to sea, river and air transports that cross the customs territory without a stop in ports or airports on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.\nAfter the notification recorded above, the carrier is obliged to present the goods, the means of transport and the accompanying documents at the place established by the customs body without changes, except for their normal wear and natural losses related to transportation and keeping them in good conditions, without using them in other purposes.\nThe goods, the means of transport and the accompanying documents are presented in the time set by the customs body, depending on the possibilities of the means of transport, the route and other conditions.\nc.      Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)\nThe AEO (Authorized Economic Operator) program is based on the partnership between customs and economic agents that voluntarily comply with customs regulations, ensure the security of goods in international traffic, cooperate with customs and, therefore, benefit from customs facilities and simplifications.\nThe AEO program aims to strengthen the security of the international supply chain and facilitate legitimate trade, being open to all participants in international trade.\nThere are two types of AEO authorizations:\nAEOC – customs simplifications;\nAEOS – security and safety.\nNote: Both types of authorizations can be held at the same time, by issuing a combined authorization.\nI. AEO benefits\nReduction in the number of documentary and physical controls, compared to other economic agents.\nPriority treatment in case of selection for customs control.\nThe possibility of choosing the place for performing customs controls.\nFacilitating access to customs simplifications – this advantage is provided by the AEOC.\nAdvance notification if the shipment has been selected for a customs control. The notification is made before the presentation of the goods to customs, but it is not made when it may compromise the results of the controls.\nExtension of the term for payment of import duties (exception: fee for customs procedures) by up to 30 calendar days.\nCrossing the border in a priority regime - without a queue and on a specially dedicated AEO lane (where the infrastructure of the customs posts allows this).\nAEO authorization also provides other indirect benefits with a positive impact on the company's image. Thus, the AEO status denotes that the respective company is a reliable partner, both in relations with customs and with business partners, but also increases customer loyalty. Additionally, AEO has an improved planning system, minimizes the risk of thefts and losses, but also of delays in transports, thanks to the improvement of security and communication between the partners involved in the logistics chain.\nCompanies can apply the AEO logo, according to the approved model, on commercial documents or otherwise to inform their partners and customers that they hold this trusted status.\nThe logo is issued upon request, by submitting an application-declaration (.docx, .pdf) to the Customs Service.\nNote: In the future, this list of facilities will be supplemented with the recognition of AEO in other states, which will provide customs advantages not only in the Republic of Moldova, but also in the countries with which the Republic of Moldova will conclude mutual recognition agreements of AEO.\nII. Obtaining AEO status\nAEO can be any economic agent from the Republic of Moldova involved in external economic transactions (importer, exporter, carrier, customs broker, holder of customs warehouses, manufacturer).\nAEO status can be applied for by all large, small or medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, this status is also accessible to newly created companies, however, for the AEO no criterion is applied that would establish the minimum duration of activity in international trade.\n \nIn the preparatory stage, the economic agent must complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (.docx, .pdf). The questionnaire is submitted to the Head office of the Customs Service together with a typed application (.docx, .pdf), accompanied by documents confirming the following information.\n•        The names and surnames of the main owners/shareholders, of the members of the board of directors, as well as the addresses of the respective parties.\n•        Name, first name of the person responsible for customs in the applicant's company.\n•        Description of the economic activities of the applicant.\n•        Details of the applicant's business locations and a brief description of the activities at each location. Details of how the applicant and each location acts in the supply chain: in its own name and on its own account or in the name and on behalf of another person.\n•        Clarifications regarding the possible links between the applicant and the companies from which they buy or to which they supply products.\n•        Description of the internal organization of the applicant's company. Any documents regarding the functions/competencies of each department will be attached.\n•        The number of employees in total and of each department.\n•        The names of the main managers (general manager, heads of departments, administrators of accounting services, responsible for the customs field). Description of the internal procedures applied when a competent employee is absent, temporarily or permanently.\n•        The name and function of the persons who have specific competences in the customs field within the organization of the applicant's company. Evaluation of the level of knowledge of these persons regarding the use of IT tools in the customs field and regarding general matters of a commercial nature.\n•        Accepting or refusing to publish the information included in the AEO authorization in the list of authorized economic agents.\nThe Customs Service, within no more than 10 calendar days, verifies the information presented and informs the economic agent about the acceptance of the request. If it is found that the application does not contain all the necessary information, the Customs Service asks the applicant to provide the relevant information, within a deadline that does not exceed 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the application.\nThe request and the attached documents are examined within 60 calendar days from the date of their acceptance. In well-founded and documented cases, the deadline can be extended by no more than 30 calendar days, with the applicant's information.\nThe AEO authorization is issued for an unlimited period.\nIn case of non-compliance with the authorization conditions, the authorization can be suspended or withdrawn.\nThe AEO authorization is suspended in the following cases:\n•        non-compliance with conditions for granting the status is found;\n•        the holder of the authorization requests said suspension, because he is temporarily unable to fulfill the conditions set out in the authorization or to comply with the obligations incumbent upon him through this authorization;\n•        there are sufficient reasons to consider that the AEO has committed a violation of customs legislation. In this case, the AEO status is suspended for the entire duration of the contravention process, in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova and the Contravention Code of the Republic of Moldova, or for the entire duration of the criminal process, according to the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Moldova;\n•        unauthorized use of the AEO logo.\nThe AEO authorization is withdrawn in the following cases:\n•        The AEO with the suspended authorization did not undertake the necessary measures and did not liquidate the identified shortcomings to comply with the requirements until the expiration of the established suspension term;\n•        AEO committed a violation of customs legislation, and the sanction applied for it became irrevocable according to a legal procedure;\n•        at the request of the AEO;\n•        AEO uses the logo during the period of suspension of the AEO authorization.\n \na.     Representative of the „White list”\nBy order of the customs service no. 592-O/28.12.2018 „Regarding the approval of the Methodology regarding the \"White List\"” aims at streamlining the traffic of goods within customs posts, reducing the number of ineffective controls, as well as reducing the level of control in low-risk customs transactions.\nThe white list presents a tool for customs posts that allow to direct internal resources to high-risk transactions and reduce the number of checks. The information regarding the \"White List\" and the economic operators found in it will be used strictly for official use, will be confidential and will not be communicated in any way to the economic operators concerned.\nThe \"White List\" is managed by the Risk Analysis Directorate within the Anti-Fraud and Compliance Department.\nEligibility criteria of economic operators to be included in the \"White List\":\n·        lack of debts towards the customs body;\n·        the number of customs declarations submitted as well as the value of the goods declared at the customs post within the scope of activity of the economic agent during a calendar year will be at least 50 customs declarations with a transaction value of over 1 million lei;\n·        import/export activities registered during the last 2 consecutive years;\n·        Lack of violations of customs legislation during the last year, including regarding the company's director, administrator;\n·        the economic agent does not hold AEO or PVD status;\n·        the history of transactions completed by the economic agent must be known at the customs post level.\n \nSection 8. Liability for violation of customs rules and procedures\nViolation of customs rules and responsibilities:\na) Confiscation, elimination, return of dual-use goods transported without permission;\nb) Sanctions provided for in the Customs Code for procedures regarding customs offences.\nc) Violations regarding export control provided for in the Criminal Code.\nThe object of this Section is liability for the violation of customs regulations that entails contravention liability or criminal liability. Therefore, we propose for your attention the brief description of contravention liability as well as criminal liability.\nCustoms contravention - means the violation of customs regulations committed through actions or inactions that attract responsibilities established in the Contravention and Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova. The customs contravention attracts administrative or material liability in accordance with the provisions of the Contravention and Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova. Contraventions in the customs field are reflected in art. 287 Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova (with criminal liability) and in art. 231 Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova (with material liability).\nCustoms violations committed in customs premises and in places where operations are carried out under customs supervision are detected and sanctioned by the persons authorized by the customs authority. If the customs contraventions are found by the police or other bodies with control powers, in places other than those previously provided, they have the obligation to immediately present the ascertaining documents to the nearest customs authority, together with the goods that are the object of the contravention. After verifying that the deed falls within the customs regulations, the customs authority applies the fine and orders, as the case may be, the detention of the goods for confiscation, but we will refer to the details a little below. Contravention sanctions can also be applied to legal entities.\nAnother part of the object of this Section is the criminal liability stipulated in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova no. 985 of 18.04.2002 in art. 14 which defines the notion of crime.\nCrime - is a prejudicial act (action or inaction), provided by the criminal law, committed with guilt and liable to criminal punishment. Customs crimes, in a general sense, refer to those crimes that consist in the crossing of goods across the border through places other than those established for customs control, without authorization of weapons, ammunition, dual-use goods, explosive or radioactive materials, products and narcotic and psychotropic substances, precursors and essential chemical substances, toxic products and substances or, in free zones, goods whose import is prohibited on the territory of the Republic of Moldova with unreal or falsified customs transport or commercial documents. The content of the crimes in the customs field is equivalent to crossing the border of the customs state of the goods by removing them from the power of disposal of the customs authorities, in circumstances precisely and limitedly determined by the law. According to the rules in force in the customs field, the customs legal regime includes all the rules provided in the internal legislation that are applied in the customs clearance procedure, depending on the purpose of the commercial operation and the destination of the goods, elaborated and applied by the public authorities, according to their powers, in in accordance with the norms of international law, treaties, agreements, conventions and protocols concluded by the state of the Republic of Moldova with other states.\nCurrently, to the extent that man coexists in society, his behavior is subject to evaluation and reaction from it. The assessment of his behavior consists in comparing it with the model of conduct established by different categories of legal, social, moral, political norms, etc.\n Compliance with these requirements of obedience to the law requires the establishment of rules of conduct in a well-defined legal framework, which configures the content of the various branches of law, including customs. Within this system that governs society, an important role is played by the legal norms, including contravention/criminal ones, which impose a certain behavior on the members of society in the relationships they establish with their peers or with social bodies, and the violation of which entails a certain form of legal liability for contravention of customs or even criminal law.\nVIOLATION OF CUSTOMS RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nConfiscation, disposal, return of dual-use goods, transportation without permission\nConfiscation\nIn order to deter criminal activities, it is essential that criminals are dispossessed of the proceeds of crime. Organized criminal groups create large-scale international networks and obtain substantial profits from various criminal activities, respectively, through money laundering, these products are reintroduced into the legal economic circuit.\nHowever, the assets of criminal groups can also be identified with the help of financial information. To be effective, any attempt to prevent and combat crime must focus on identifying, tracking, freezing or seizing and confiscating the instruments and proceeds of crime.\nTherefore, we will refer to the notion of: special confiscation and extended confiscation.\n \nThe special confiscation is regulated in art. 106 of the Criminal Code, being a security measure that consists in the forced and free transfer of the following assets (including foreign currency values) into the state's ownership;\nGoods used or intended for the commission of a crime:\n• constituted a means of committing the act (for example, the car used by the defendant to commit the crime of smuggling, the means of transporting illegal migrants, etc.);\n• were used by the perpetrators to keep the connection in carrying out the criminal activity and to coordinate the criminal acts (for example, communication devices, technical means - laptops, computers, units of measurement).\nIt is irrelevant how the goods were used in the commission of the offense - in any way. The object of confiscation will be, for example, an asset that is not exclusively intended for the purpose of committing a crime, but, along with its legal purpose, is also used for this purpose, for example, a car used for legal transport activities, but in which, taking advantage of the legal burden, are hidden goods held against the legal provisions.\nThe measure of confiscation, in the situation presented, can only be taken in the case of intentional crimes, and not of those due to imprudence, in the latter situation it cannot be considered that the perpetrator used the respective asset to commit the crime.\nThe good must belong to the perpetrator or, if it belongs to another person, he must have known the purpose of its use. When the good belongs to the perpetrator, it is enough to establish that he used that good, in any way, to commit the act. If the asset is the property of another person and was used by the perpetrator when committing the crime, it must be established that that person knew the purpose of the use, without being in any way a participant in that act.\nAssets resulting from crimes, as well as any income from the capitalization of these assets, respectively:\n• which came into the property/possession of the perpetrator through the realization of the material element (for example, sums of money obtained by committing the crime of tax evasion, evasion, illegal income from the sale of drugs, weapons, dual-use goods from sexual exploitation, through work , from other illegal activities that generate profit);\n• which replace the goods originally acquired by committing the act (objects bought with the money obtained by committing the crime).\nIn principle, goods in this category are confiscated to the extent that they are not returned to the injured person or in a position to serve to compensate him. These goods can be confiscated only if the injured person does not become a civil party or if the civil party waives compensation or when the injured party does not demand the restitution of the stolen goods or to be compensated by a monetary equivalent.\nIf the defendant used the stolen sums for the purchase of goods or the stolen goods were transformed into money, they will be confiscated under the same conditions, i.e. to the extent that they do not serve to compensate the civil party.\nIf the asset acquired through the commission of the crime was alienated to a bona fide acquirer, it cannot be confiscated, but the defendant is obliged to pay the amount obtained through the alienation of the asset subject to confiscation.\n \nConfiscation of the consideration\nIf these goods no longer exist, cannot be found or cannot be recovered, their value is confiscated. If the assets resulting from crimes and the income from these assets have been merged with the legally acquired assets, that part of the assets or their equivalent value that corresponds to the value of the assets resulting from crimes and the income from these assets is confiscated. If the goods used or intended for the commission of a crime; those resulting from crimes, as well as any income from the capitalization of these goods belong to or were transferred onerous to a person who did not know and should not have known about the purpose of use or the origin of the goods, their value is confiscated.\nThe crimes provided for in art. 248, 2481, 2482 of the Criminal Code have as their material object - currency or other movable assets, which are used/acquired when committing the crime.\nAccording to the provisions of art. 106 paragraph (2) of the Criminal Code, assets (including currency values) used or intended for the commission of a crime, resulting from crimes, as well as any income from the capitalization of these goods or data to determine the commission of a crime, are subject to special confiscation crimes or to reward the offender.\nFrom the considerations set out above, if at the stage of the criminal investigation, for certain reasons, seizure was not applied to the assets used in the commission of the crime or of the defendant (in case of their existence), at the preparatory stage of the court session or starting with this (a good part of the mentioned cases are examined on the basis of art. 3641 Criminal Procedure Code), in order to execute the provisions mentioned above, the state prosecutor must initially accumulate information (including from the databases available to the prosecutor's office) related to the existence of movable assets , real estate and financial means owned by the defendant, and later request the court to apply the seizure on them in order to ensure the confiscation of the assets used/resulting from the commission of the crime.\nIn the same context, in the cases provided by art. 1061 of the Criminal Code, the state prosecutor is to ensure during the trial of the case measures for the application of the respective provisions that establish the forced and free transfer into the state property of certain assets, which belong to the person who committed a crime, due to their origin from criminal activities of the same nature, carried out by the respective person, constantly, for a certain period of time, prior to the crime for which they are convicted.\nThe confiscation orders\nThe special confiscation as a safety measure is ordered, as a rule, by the court decision convicting the perpetrator for committing a crime.\nBut the measure can be applied even if a criminal penalty is not imposed on the perpetrator. This is also ordered in the case when the court pronounces the termination of the criminal process on grounds of non-rehabilitation, noting the intervention of some reasoned cause (here would be the absence or withdrawal of the prior complaint, amnesty, the death of the perpetrator, reconciliation, intervention of the limitation period, etc.).\nThe special confiscation can be applied by the court also in the case when the person's criminal liability is replaced by the liability that attracts a contravention sanction, because even in this case there is a crime, only the punishment for it being replaced (from a criminal one to a contravention one, art.55 of the Criminal Code).\nConfiscation is a measure applied in rem, respectively on assets related to the crime. For this reason, it is imprescriptible and is not affected by causes that lead to the termination of the criminal process or that remove criminal liability.\nIn the case of crimes committed through a press organ or any other means of mass information, the special confiscation does not apply.\nEnforcement of the confiscation measure\nThe enforcement of the special confiscation measure is done based on the provisions of the Enforcement Code, by the bailiffs (art. 174 paragraph (5))\nAccording to art. 293 of the Enforcement Code, the court that, based on art. 106 of the Criminal Code, ordered the confiscation of the goods used in the commission of the crime or resulting from the crime or their value, sends its decision to the bailiff in whose territorial competence, established of the territorial chamber of bailiffs, the assets are located.\nThe bailiff collects and transmits the assets subject to confiscation to the competent body, in the manner established by the Government. In case of confiscation of narcotic, psychotropic substances or precursors, weapons and ammunition, the bailiff collects them and sends them to the competent body.\nAbout the lifting and transmission of the confiscated objects to the competent bodies, the bailiff informs the court that issued the decision, within 5 days.\nIn the execution process, if another person considers that the seizure for the execution of the confiscation has been applied to the goods belonging to him as property, he can file an action to lift the seizure in a contentious procedure (art. 164 of the Enforcement Code). If the seizure (inventory) of the assets was made on the basis of a criminal decision regarding the confiscation of the assets, the action to lift the seizure (deletion from the inventory act) is filed against the convicted person and the respective financial body, which will appear as the defendant.\nThe action to lift the seizure filed by third parties is examined in a contentious procedure under the terms of the Civil Procedure Code. The court decision can be appealed. The decision of the court of appeal is not subject to appeal, being final and irrevocable from the time it is pronounced.\nIn the same way, the regime of seized goods, including those that are administered by the Agency for the Recovery of Criminal Assets, upon the pronouncement of a final decision by the court, is to be regulated according to the provisions of the Regulation on the manner of recording, evaluation and sale of confiscated, ownerless, sequestered assets that can be easily altered or with a limited retention period, bodies of crimes, assets passed into the possession of the state with the right of succession and treasures, approved by Government Decision no. 972/2001.\nThe confiscated goods are capitalized by the State Fiscal Service.\nThe Agency for the Recovery of Criminal Assets ensures the unique record keeping of the information regarding the criminal assets in respect of which the seizure, special confiscation or extended confiscation was ordered, including by creating a specialized database in this regard.\nExtended confiscation\nWhile the special confiscation consists in the forced and free transfer into the state property of assets including currency values used in the commission of crimes or resulting from crimes, then the extended confiscation is also subject to other assets, which, although they were not used in the commission of the crimes, but their origin results from certain criminal activities.\nThis measure consists in the forced and free transfer into the state property of certain assets, which belong to the person who committed a crime, due to their origin from criminal activities of the same nature, carried out by that person, constantly, in a certain period of time, prior to the crime for which she is convicted.\nThis measure has a wider range of application, which allows the confiscation of assets other than those mentioned in art. 106 of the Criminal Code, such as: money and assets that cover the value of the assets subject to confiscation that are not found or have been merged with the assets legally acquired, as well as those money or assets obtained from the exploitation or use of the assets subject to confiscation, including those assets into which the assets derived from criminal activities were transformed or converted, as well as the income or benefits obtained from these assets.\nIn domestic law, extended confiscation is regulated as a security measure, thus as a criminal law sanction.\nExtended confiscation was introduced by Law no. 326 of 23.12.2013, in force from 25.02.2014, when the Criminal Code was supplemented with a new article 1061.\nReturn of goods in case of prohibitions\nThe general principles of the passage of goods and means of transport across the customs border stipulate that all persons benefit from equal rights to import and export goods and means of transport from the Republic of Moldova, no one can be deprived of the right to import and export from the Republic of Moldova goods and means of transport or cannot be limited in this right, except for the cases provided by this code and other normative acts. But there are cases where the legislator imposes certain restrictions.\nIn accordance with the provisions of art. 20 paragraph (1) of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova, it stipulates that certain goods and means of transport are prohibited by law to be introduced or taken out of the Republic of Moldova for reasons of state security, ensuring order public and moral, protection of the environment, objects of art, objects of historical and archaeological value, protection of the right to intellectual property, protection of the internal market, protection of other interests of the Republic of Moldova. The goods and means of transport that fall under para. (1) they must be immediately removed from the Republic of Moldova or returned to the country if they are not subject to confiscation according to the legislation of the Republic of Moldova, the international agreements to which it is a party. The removal or return of goods and means of transport in the Republic of Moldova is carried out at the expense of the person who passes the goods across the customs border or at the expense of the carrier. If the goods and means of transport cannot be taken out or returned immediately to the customs territory, they are kept in temporary warehouses for a maximum of 3 days.\nAdditional Government Decision no. 1140 of 02.11.2005 for the approval of the \"Regulation for the application of customs destinations provided by the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova\" in points 422-424 describes the return of goods and means of transport not cleared by customs.\nRespectively, goods and means of transport not cleared by customs in the established manner and under customs supervision in control areas of the border customs bodies can be returned in compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. The return of the goods is carried out at the request of the authorized person regarding the goods or, in justified cases, at the initiative of the customs authorities. The return of the goods is perfected by the customs bodies by entering the respective mentions in the documents accompanying the goods or means of transport, as well as recording the operation in the appropriate registers. The customs declaration in this case is not submitted. In the case of goods transported with the use of transit documents provided for by the international agreements to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, registrations regarding the return are carried out in compliance with the procedure established by the respective agreements.\nConditions for the application of extended confiscation\nThe court orders extended confiscation if it has verified the fulfillment of several conditions:\n The value of the assets acquired by the convicted person, in a period of 5 years before and, if necessary, after the moment of committing the crime, until the date of issuance of the act of referral to the court, clearly exceeds the income obtained by him in a lawful manner.\nThe application of the measure presupposes, respectively, the establishment of a time interval that starts five years before the date of the crime for which the conviction was ordered and ends on the date the indictment is issued.\nIn relation to this period, the total amount of lawful income acquired by the convicted person and the difference between this amount and the total assets acquired in the same period will be analyzed, in order to establish whether there is an obvious disproportion.\nIf by the time the proceeds of the crime have not been \"reinvested\" by the defendant and after the date of notification to the court, the defendant acquires new assets through third parties, they are not presumed to have been lawfully acquired, as their source may even be the advantage financially obtained following the commission of the crime for which he was sent to court.\nIf certain previously acquired assets are discovered after issuing the indictment, the court, at the request of the prosecutor, may institute precautionary measures, and these assets will be taken into account for the assessment of the apparent disproportion.\nThe court is convinced that the respective goods come from criminal activities of the nature provided for in art. 1061 paragraph (1) of the Criminal Code.\nThe scope of application of the measure was established by providing precisely the categories of crimes for which the institution of extended confiscation may be incident, provided that the deed was committed for material interest - if the person is convicted for committing the crimes provided for in articles 158 , 165, 206, 2081, 2082, 217–2174, 218–220, 236–240, 243, 248–253, 256, 2603, 2604, 279, 280, 283, 284, 290, 292, 302, 324 -329 , 3302, 332–3351 of the Criminal Code.\n- Extended confiscation can be ordered regarding:\n- the person who committed the crime and is convicted;\n- a family member;\n- legal entities over which the convicted person has control;\n- to other people who knew or should have known about the illegal acquisition of goods.\nWhen applying the extended confiscation, the value of the assets transferred to the latter by the convicted person or a third party will also be considered. If the goods subject to confiscation are not found or have been combined with the legally acquired goods, money and goods covering their value are confiscated in their place.\nAssets and money obtained from the exploitation or use of the assets subject to confiscation are also confiscated, including the assets into which the assets derived from criminal activities were transformed or converted, as well as the income or benefits obtained from these assets. The confiscation cannot exceed the value of the goods acquired during the period indicated in art. 1061 of the Criminal Code, which exceeds the level of the lawful income of the convicted person.\nThe sanctions provided for in the Customs Code for procedures regarding customs contraventions.\nAny form of legal liability, including customs contravention, objectively results from the commission of an illegal act that gives rise to the right of the state to apply the sanction provided for by the violated legal norm and the obligation of the perpetrator to bear the consequences of the act committed in accordance with the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova or the Contravention one of the Republic of Moldova depending on the legal classification of the act committed.\nContravention liability is a specific form of legal liability, and non-compliance with the rules of contravention law has negative consequences both for citizens, in particular, and for society, in general. For these reasons, at the present moment, in the theory and practice of law, the problem of administrative liability in the field of Customs Law is perceived as a current one and with maximum difficulties.\nIn order to delimit customs contraventions depending on the form of liability, be it material or contravention, we propose to initially define the notion of contravention, and in this sense, the Contravention Code of the Republic of Moldova in art. 10 stipulates that the illegal act - action or inaction - constitutes a contravention, with a lower degree of social danger than the crime, committed culpably, which attacks the social values protected by law, is provided for by the Contravention Code and is subject to a contravention sanction.\nThe Romanian legal dictionary defines the contravention as the deed committed with guilt, which presents a lower social danger than the crime and is provided for and sanctioned as such by laws, decrees or by normative acts of the bodies shown in the law.\nAs a result of the description of the notions of contravention, I propose for your attention the definition of the customs contravention which according to art. 228 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova means: - violation of customs regulations committed through actions or inactions that attract liabilities established in the Contravention Code of the Republic of Moldova and in the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova. Thus, in order to establish the form of contravention liability in the customs field, we are of the opinion that contravention liability consists in the application by the authorized body of the sanction against the person who committed a contravention. The only legal basis for the application of contravention liability is the contravention committed with guilt.\nTherefore, it should be underlined that contravention liability is a legal form of punishment for people who have committed a deed, action or inaction called a contravention, and are obliged to bear the contravention sanction established by the competent bodies.\nBecause of the identification of the notion and the elements of the contravention, of the contravention liability, it is proceeded to the direct analysis of the delimitation of the contravention that may attract contravention or material liability in accordance with the provisions of the Contravention and Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova. Thus, in order to delimit the contraventions in the customs field, it should be specified that they are reflected in art. 287 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova (with criminal liability) and at 231 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova (with material liability).\nTherefore, we can mention that the following customs contraventions are considered violations of customs regulations liable to material liability:\n 1) crossing the customs border of goods by evading customs control or concealing them;\n 2) the passage of goods across the customs border with forged, invalid or illegally acquired documents;\n 3) non-declaration, within the established terms, of the goods upon importation;\n 4) the transport, storage, procurement of goods introduced into the customs territory with the evasion of customs control or hidden from it, or with the use of false, undeclared or declared inauthentic documents or identification means, as well as the transport, storage, procurement of goods for which facilities are provided to the payment of import or export duties, to their use or alienation for purposes other than those for which the facilities were granted and without the authorization of the customs body;\n5) non-compliance by the holder of the suspensive customs regime with the terms, obligations and conditions established for the development and termination of this regime;\n6) submission of the customs declaration or the accompanying documents containing erroneous data about the customs regime, the invoiced value, the customs value, the type, the code, the quantity or the origin of the transported goods, if this fact leads to the total or partial exemption from import duties.\n 61) submission of the customs declaration or accompanying documents containing erroneous/incomplete data regarding intellectual property objects;\n7) the presentation to the customs body of documents containing unauthentic data about the recognition of the right to the restitution of import or export rights collected, the receipt of sums and compensations, their non-restitution or their partial restitution without reason, in the absence of the constitutive elements of the crime;\n8) non-payment of import or export rights within the established terms, in the absence of the constitutive elements of the crime;\n9) putting the goods into circulation without the permission of the customs body, losing the goods and means of transport under customs supervision or not transporting them to the place indicated by the customs body; 10) loss or non-handover to the customs body of documents for goods under customs supervision;\n11) non-fulfilment of the obligation to declare to the customs body the change in the destination of the goods compared to the declared purpose when placing the goods under a certain customs destination;\n12) non-compliance with the requirements and conditions for destruction of goods and/or waste;\n13) carrying out operations on the goods, their transformation, use and disposal in violation of the customs regime in which they were placed, except for the cases provided for by the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova;\n14) non-compliance with economic policy measures and other restrictions provided for the passage of goods across the customs border, except for the cases provided for by this code, in the absence of the constituent elements of the crime;\n15) crossing the customs border of goods intended for trade or production under the category of goods not intended for trade or

losses incurred as a result of their transport or storage, in the absence of the constitutive elements of the crime;\n19) alienation in any form of goods under the customs transit regime;\n20) failure to ensure the release or reception conditions, in accordance with the customs regime, of the goods and means of transport whose term of storage in the warehouse has expired;\n21) wholesale and retail

authorizations.\n23) non-compliance with the transit procedure, which did not lead to the disappearance of goods in transit.\n24) exercising the activity of a customs broker without holding the appropriate license (2, art. 231).\nAt the same time, it is necessary to establish that the following customs contraventions are considered a violation of customs regulations liable to criminal liability:\n1) Failure to stop the vehicle crossing the state border of the Republic of Moldova in the place where the customs body is located, as well as starting, admitting the start without the authorization of the customs body of the vehicle (including the vehicle for personal use) under customs control.\n2) Mooring of other floating constructions to the ship under customs control without

the Recommendation of the SCJ regarding some aspects of the examination of customs contraventions by courts no. 64 of 01.04.2014, where the Criminal Board of the Supreme Court of Justice delimits the customs contraventions through the following explanations. The contravention process, in accordance with the provisions of art. 374 of the Contravention Code is an activity carried out by the competent authority with the aim of detecting the contravention, examining and resolving the contravention case.\nAs for the extension of the attributions in the matter of contravention law, the provision of art. 403 para. (1) The contravention code exhaustively identifies the contraventions whose detection/examination is up to the customs authorities. Taking into account the provisions of the noted rule, contraventions in the customs field art. 79 paragraph (3), art. 265, 287, 2871, 2872 are examined by the Customs Service.\nAn essential difference between the two forms of customs contravention is also the method of sanctioning. Thus, in the case of customs contraventions with contravention liability, the sanction is applied in the form of the conventional units established by the corresponding paragraph of the committed act which is provided by art. 287 Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova. In the case of the customs contravention with material liability, art. 232 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova, which provides that legal persons or persons carrying out entrepreneurial activity without establishing themselves as a legal person, for committing the customs contraventions provided for in: a) art. 231 point 1), 2), 4), 5 ) and 19), are sanctioned with a fine from 40% to 100% of the value of the goods that were the object of the contravention or with their confiscation; b) art.231 point 3), are sanctioned with a fine from 4% to 10% of the value of goods not declared within the established terms; b1) art. 231 point 6) are sanctioned with a fine from 40% to 100% of the value of the object of the contravention or with the confiscation of the goods that were the object of the contravention, and in the case of finding the contravention by the customs body, following the subsequent control, for the customs declarations distributed on the yellow or red customs control lanes and which were automatically validated with the granting of customs clearance, with a fine of 4% of the value of the object of the contravention; c) art. 231 points 9) and 11), are sanctioned with a fine from 10% to 20% of the value of the goods that were the object of the contravention, with or without the withdrawal of the authorization, and in case of finding by the customs body, following the subsequent control of the contravention provided for in point 11) for the customs declarations assigned to the yellow or red customs control lanes and which were automatically validated with the granting of customs clearance, with a fine of 4% of the value of the goods that constituted the object of the contravention; d) art. 231 point 61) and 7), are sanctioned with a fine from 10% to 20% of the value of the goods for which documents containing inauthentic data were presented; e) in art. 231 point 8), are sanctioned with a fine from 10% to 20% of the value of the goods for which the import or export rights have not been paid; f) art. 231 point 10), are sanctioned with a fine from 3% to 10% of the value of goods and means of transport whose documents were lost or not delivered; g) art. 231 points 12), 13), 16) and 22) are sanctioned with a fine from 5% to 20% of the value of the goods, objects that constituted the object of the contravention; h) art. 231 point 14), 15), 17), 18), 20), 21), are sanctioned with a fine from 10% to 100% of the value of the goods and other goods that were the object of the contravention, with or without withdrawal of authorization. i) art.231 point 23), are sanctioned with a fine of 3% of the value of the goods. j) art. 231 point 24) are fined from 0.1% to 0.5% of the amount established in art. 163 para. (2) lit. c) [2, art. 232].\nA similarity between customs contraventions, both with contravention and material liability, constitutes the limitation period, which according to art. 2291 and 2292 Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova constitutes 1 year, or art. 2291 of the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova stipulates \"Prescription of contravention liability is provided for in art. 30 of the Contravention Code of the Republic of Moldova\" and thus, art. 30 of the Contravention Code of the Republic of Moldova identifies that the prescription removes contravention liability and the general term of prescription of contravention liability is for one year [1, art. 30]. With similar provisions comes the Customs Code of the Republic of Moldova in the case of the prescription of the customs contravention with material liability where in art. 2292 provides that the prescription removes material liability and the limitation period for material liability is 1 year [1, art. 2292 ]. We consider it important to also mention that if the person, until the initiation of the subsequent control, for the customs declarations assigned to the yellow or red customs control lanes and which were automatically validated with the granting of customs clearance, communicates on his own initiative, in writing to the body customs on the commission of customs offenses provided for in art. 231 point 6) and point 11), with the annexation of the supporting documents, it is released from material and contravention liability, on the condition of the indisputable and voluntary payment of the due import rights and the calculated penalties.\nHeads of customs offices and posts and their deputies, as well as heads of mobile teams of the Customs Service, have the right to examine contravention cases and apply sanctions.\nExport control violations provided for in the Criminal Code.\nFurther, part of the object of this Section is the criminal liability stipulated in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova no. 985 of 18.04.2002, namely by art. 14 the law defines the notion of crime as:\nCrime - is a prejudicial act (action or inaction), provided by the criminal law, committed with guilt and liable to criminal punishment.\nThe end of the 20th century, marked by the fall of communism, also meant the beginning of the process of raising the iron curtain, interposed between the two world systems, capitalism and communism. These phenomena favored the emergence and evolution of the globalization process and, as a consequence, the establishment and application of the principles of a new world order, but, on the other hand, they also meant a kind of opening of a Pandora's box, leaving a free way for some threats slipped from under the corset of vanished bipolarism.\nAgainst the background of these profound transformations, but also of many others, which we no longer remember, new phenomena appeared, amplified and diversified, such as organized crime, illicit drug trafficking, trafficking of explosive, chemical materials , radioactive, dual-use goods, terrorism, informational aggression accompanied by crime in this field, as well as many such manifestations, which hinder the peaceful processes of progress of nations, affect the peace and safety of citizens.\nAccording to a generally accepted definition, smuggling consists of the clandestine passage across the border of goods prohibited or evaded from payment of customs duties, being one of the main forms of fraud at the level of the European Union as well as in the Republic of Moldova. In order to avoid paying the customs duties due when the goods enter the territory of the Republic of Moldova, the persons in question resort either to actual smuggling or to evading customs transit procedures. In this context, the Republic of Moldova with aspirations of EU integration, through international conventions also assuming a series of obligations regarding the repression or control of traffic with certain goods, is directly responsible for the prevention, discovery and sanctioning of crimes in the customs regime, known crimes, often, in connection with money laundering, the financing of acts of terrorism and organized crime.\nAccording to art. 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the prosecution of the crimes provided for in art. 248, art. 2481, art. 2482 and art. 249 of the Criminal Code is the competence of the criminal investigation body of the Customs Service.\nArticle 248 of the Criminal Code stipulates the notion of smuggling, namely:\nSmuggling constitutes, in accordance with the legal text, the introduction or removal from the country, by any means, of goods or merchandise, through places other than those established for the customs control of goods or other goods. At the same time, the legislator defines in Article 224 of the Customs Code the notion of Contraband, contraband is considered to be the criminal act for which criminal liability is provided in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nThe action or inaction which, although, formally, contains the signs of a fact provided by this code, but, being unimportant, does not present the prejudicial degree of a crime does not constitute a crime. The prejudicial degree of the crime is determined according to the signs that characterize the elements of the crime: the object, the objective side, the subject and the subjective side. Depending on the nature and degree of prejudice, the offenses provided by the criminal code are classified in the following categories: light, less serious, serious, particularly serious and exceptionally serious.\nResponsible natural persons who, at the time of committing the crime, have reached the age of 16 are liable to criminal liability.\nThe state's obligation is to criminalize and combat customs crimes, mainly smuggling, also derives from the provisions of international normative acts to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, to which it has acceded or ratified, based on which the state assumed its obligation to ensure the rights and freedoms of all persons, regardless of citizenship or nationality, in its customs territory, including the elimination of the risk of any harm caused by the commission of the crime of smuggling. In particular, lit. b) paragraph (1) art. 16 of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and its member states, on the one hand, and the Republic of Moldova, on the other, it is established, among other things, that the parties they will cooperate in preventing and combating the smuggling of goods, including small arms and drugs.\nSmuggling constitutes, in accordance with the legal text, the introduction or removal from the country, by any means, of goods or merchandise, through places other than those established for the customs control of goods or other goods. In the assimilated version, the crime of smuggling is also:\na) disposal or release into free circulation, without payment of import duties, of goods under customs supervision, if the value of the goods is greater than 8000 conventional units;\nb) removing the goods from the territory of the country by falsely declaring the origin of the goods as having been obtained entirely in the Republic of Moldova, if their value is greater than 8000 conventional units;\nc) the introduction into/out of the country of cultural values, both through places established for customs control, and through places other than those established for customs control, by hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose, or with the fraudulent use of documents or means of customs identification, or by non-declaration or inauthentic declaration in the customs documents, as well as the non-return of cultural values to the territory of the country if their return is mandatory;\nd) introduction into/out of the country, both through places established for customs control, and through places other than those established for customs control, by hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose, or by fraudulent use of documents or means of customs identification, or by non-declaration or inauthentic declaration in customs documents, of drugs, precursors, ethnobotanicals or their analogues, of toxic and noxious substances, of weapons and ammunition prohibited in the civilian circuit or subject to authorization, of the essential components of firearms, of strategic goods, military devices, explosive, nuclear or radioactive materials;\ne) the introduction into/out of the country of goods subject to excise duties, through places established for customs control, by hiding from customs control, by hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose, or with the fraudulent use of documents or means of customs identification , or by non-declaration or inauthentic declaration in the customs documents or in other border crossing documents, if the value of the goods is greater than 4000 conventional units, and in the case of cigarettes with or without a filter – a quantity greater than 60,000 pieces;\nf) the introduction into/out of the country of goods subject to excise duties, through places other than those established for customs control, if their value is greater than 2000 conventional units, and in the case of cigarettes with or without a filter - a greater amount of 30000 pieces;\ng) alienation or putting into free circulation without payment of import duties of excise goods under customs supervision, if their value is greater than 4,000 conventional units, and in the case of cigarettes with or without a filter - a quantity greater than 60,000 pieces.\nThe special legal object of the crimes provided for in art. 248 of the Criminal Code is formed by social relations regarding the customs security of the Republic of Moldova.\nIn the case of the crimes specified in paragraphs (5) and (6) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, it affects, on a secondary level, social relations regarding the legal circulation of cultural values, drugs, precursors, ethnobotanicals or their analogues, of toxic or harmful substances, weapons or ammunition prohibited in the civilian circuit or subject to authorization, essential components of firearms, strategic goods, military devices, explosive, nuclear or radioactive materials.\nIn such cases, social values located on a secondary level (and related social relations) constitute the secondary legal object of the crimes provided for in paragraphs (5) and (6) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code. In the analyzed conditions, the special legal object of these crimes has a multiple character.\nThe material (immaterial) object of the crimes specified in art. 248 of the Criminal Code is to be examined according to the concrete version under which the contraband appears.\nThus, in the case of the offenses provided for in paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, the tangible (immaterial) object is the goods (except for those mentioned in paragraphs (3), (5) and (6) art. 248 of the Criminal Code).\nAccording to point 1) art. 1 of the Customs Code, by \"goods\" is meant \"any movable property: objects and other values, including currency values (foreign currency and national currency in cash, payment instruments and materialized securities expressed in foreign currency and national currency), natural gas, electricity, thermal energy, other types of energy, as well as means of transport (which are the subject of an external economic transaction), except for those provided for in point 4)\".\nTo be able to constitute the material (immaterial) object of the crimes provided for in paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, the goods must have a value that exceeds: 8000 conventional units (in the case crimes specified in paragraphs (1) and (4)); 4000 conventional units (in the case of the offense provided for in paragraph (2)). If the value of these goods does not exceed 8000/4000 conventional units, then those committed are subject to qualification according to paragraph (10) or (101) art. 287 of the Criminal Code.\nIn the case of the crimes specified in para. (1), (2) and (4) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, it is essential that the value of the goods, which constitute the material (immaterial) object of the crime, does not exceed 16,000 conventional units. Otherwise, liability will apply for the offense provided for in letter c) paragraph (7) art. 248 of the Criminal Code.\nThe material (immaterial) object of the other crimes provided for in art. 248 of the Criminal Code is alternatively represented by:\na) goods under customs supervision, if their value is greater than 8,000 conventional units (in the case of the offense provided for in paragraph (3));\nb) b) cultural values (in the case of the offense provided for in paragraph (5)).\nc) c) drugs, precursors, ethnobotanicals or their analogues, toxic or harmful substances, weapons or ammunition prohibited in the civilian circuit or subject to authorization, essential components of firearms, strategic goods, military devices, explosive, nuclear or radioactive materials (in the case of the offense provided for in paragraph (6)).\nAnd here we will stop in more detail because it is the subject addressed in this chapter. A first notion used in paragraph (6) art. 248 of the Criminal Code - \"weapons or ammunition prohibited in the civil circuit or subject to authorization\".\nAccording to art. 2 of Law no. 130 of 08.06.2012 on the regime of weapons and ammunition for civilian use (hereinafter - Law no. 130/2012), by \"weapon\" is meant \"the object or device, designed or adapted, by which a lead, a bullet or another projectile or a gaseous, liquid or other noxious substance can be discharged with the help of an explosive, gaseous or atmospheric pressure or by means of other propellant agents, to the extent that it is found in one of the categories provided in annex no. 1\"; \"ammunition\" means \"the assembly consisting of the cartridge tube, the propellant charge, the firing pin and, where applicable, the projectile\".\nAccording to the same article, \"prohibited weapons and ammunition\" are \"arms and ammunition in category A, according to annex no. 1, the procurement, possession, carrying and use of which are prohibited for natural and legal persons\".\nAs for the weapons subject to authorization, they represent Category B, according to annex no. 1 to Law no. 130/2012.\nWeapons that, according to annex no. 1 to Law no. 130/2012, represent Category C \"Weapons that are the subject of the declaration\" and Category D do not constitute the material object of the crime, provided for in paragraph (6) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code \"Other weapons not subject to authorization\".\nIn art. 2 of Law no. 130/2012, the enumerative definition of another notion is formulated which is referred to in para. (6) art. 248 CP RM: \"essential component of a firearm - closing mechanism, chamber of the cartridge and/or barrel of the firearm which, as separate objects, are included in the category of firearms on which they are mounted or are designed to be mounted\".\nIn other words, the definition of the notion of \"strategic goods\" is formulated in art. 13417: \"a) products, technologies and services that have dual use (civilian and military); b) armaments, ammunition, military equipment, technologies and related services; c) products, technologies and services that are used in the manufacture and use of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and missiles that can carry such weapons; d) other products, technologies and services that require special control in the interest of national security or foreign policy, in accordance with international agreements and arrangements to which the Republic of Moldova is a party\".\nThe following notion used in para. (6) art. 248 of the Criminal Code - \"military devices\" - is defined in art. 4 of Law no. 147 of 14.07.2017 on the regime of conventional weapons and ammunition, special means and military devices owned by the National Army and foreign military forces legally located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova: \"the assembly of components whose joint operation fulfills a function in a technical system, through the actuation of an initiation or percussion mechanism, which causes the throwing of one or more projectiles, explosive, lit or luminous substances, incendiary mixtures or the spreading of harmful, irritating or neutralizing gases\". The exhaustive list of military devices is presented in the Order of the Ministry of Defense no. 34 of 22.01.2019 regarding the approval of the Nomenclature of conventional armaments and ammunition, military devices and special means.\nThe notion of \"explosive materials\" is another notion used in paragraph (6) art. 248 of the Criminal Code.\nAccording to letter a) point 3 of annex no. 1 to Government Decision no. 138 of 10.02.2009 regarding the approval of technical regulations, explosives are considered \"materials and articles considered to be explosive in the United Nations Recommendations on the transport of dangerous products and which falls into class 1 of these recommendations\". Substances and articles considered to be explosive are described in Vol. I of the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.\nThe notion of \"nuclear material\" is defined in art. 1348 of the Criminal Code: \"(1) Nuclear material means: plutonium, with the exception of plutonium whose concentration of isotopes in plutonium 238 exceeds 80%; uranium 233; uranium enriched in uranium 235 or 233; uranium containing the mixture of isotopes found in nature other than in the form of ore or ore residue; any material containing one or more of the elements mentioned in this paragraph. (2) Uranium enriched in uranium 235 or uranium 233 means uranium that contains either uranium 235 or uranium 233, or these two isotopes in such a quantity that the ratio between the sum of these two isotopes and the isotope 238 is higher than the ratio between isotope 235 and isotope 238 from natural uranium\".\nFinally, the notion of \"radioactive material\" is defined in art. 4 of Law no. 132 of 08.06.2012 on the safe conduct of nuclear and radiological activities:\n- \"radioactive material - any material, in any state of aggregation, that presents the phenomenon of radioactivity, including radioactive waste\";\n- \"radioactive waste - the materials, articles, installations, any type of objects in any form that contain or are contaminated with radionuclides in concentrations higher than the exclusion limits and for which no further use has been and will not be foreseen\".\nIt should be specified that the entities, which constitute the material or immaterial object of the crime provided for in paragraph (6) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, are not goods within the meaning of paragraphs (1)-(4) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, of point 1) art. 1 of the Customs Code and letter f) art. 2 of Law no. 1569/2002. In the case of such entities, the special quality of the material or immaterial object of the crime is exclusively relevant. Due to this fact, regardless of the monetary value of the respective entities, only para. (6) art. 248 of the Criminal Code.\nThe objective side of the crimes, provided for in art. 248 CP RM, has a different structure and/or different content.\nThus, in the case of the crime specified in paragraph (1) of art. 248 of the Criminal Code, the objective side includes the following three signs:\n1) the prejudicial act which consists in the action of introducing or removing goods from the territory of the Republic of Moldova;\n2) the place of commission of the crime – the places established for customs control;\n3) the methods of committing the crime:\na) hiding from customs control;\nb) hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose;\nc) fraudulent use of documents or means of customs identification;\nd) non-declaration;\ne) inauthentic declaration in customs documents or other border crossing documents.\nArising from point 5) art.1 of the Customs Code, the action of introducing or removing goods from the territory of the Republic of Moldova can be carried out including through international postal shipments, through pipelines or through electric transmission lines.\nWe mention that, in the sense of para. (1) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, the introduction into or removal from the territory of the Republic of Moldova of goods is an eminently illegal action. Violation of export or import rules is not considered, when, in general, the perpetrator acts within the \"field of legality\". Thus, for example, the violation of the rules established for the import or export of drugs or of materials or equipment intended for the production or processing of drugs, which caused their loss, committed by the person whose obligations include compliance with the mentioned rules, attracts liability according to para. (4 ) art. 218 of the Criminal Code. Also, violating the established rules regarding the import or export of radioactive, bacteriological or toxic substances, materials and waste, as well as pesticides, herbicides or other chemical substances, if this creates the danger of causing essential damage to the health of the population or the environment, is criminalized to art. 224 of the Criminal Code. Liability for the violation of export or import rules is also established in paragraph (2) art.140, paragraph (1) art.142, paragraph (9) art.154, paragraph (12) art. 196, art. 262 or others of the Criminal Code. In such cases, the subject of the act can only be the person whose obligations include compliance with the import or export rules. In contrast, in the case of the crime specified in para. (1) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, it is not indispensable for the subject of the crime to have such a special quality.\nAs for the place of commission of the offense provided for in paragraph (1) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with art. 26 of the Customs Code, \"the passage of goods and means of transport across the customs border is allowed only in the places established by the customs body and during his schedule\" (para. (1)); \"with the consent of the customs body, the passage of goods and means of transport across the customs border can be carried out in other places and during extra hours\" (para. (2)).\nWith regard to the methods of committing the crime specified in paragraph (1) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, by \"hiding from customs control\" is meant the non-presentation for customs control of goods that cross the customs border of the Republic of Moldova, on a way that prevents their examination and detection, but otherwise than by hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose.\nBy \"hiding in places specially prepared or adapted for this purpose\" is meant the non-presentation for customs control of goods that cross the customs border of the Republic of Moldova, by using the hidden places of the body, clothes, personal items, reused places or accommodated in means of transport as hiding places, etc.\nBy \"fraudulent use of documents or means of customs identification\" it is considered that the perpetrator uses, as means (instruments) of committing the crime: a) false documents (including documents that refer to goods other than those that are in reality accompanied by such documents); b) invalid documents; c) documents obtained illegally; d) false customs identification means (including customs identification means that refer to goods other than those that were actually identified with the means in question).\nIn the examined context, \"documents\" must be understood, as the case may be: a) customs documents (customs declaration, certificate of origin of the goods, invoice, account-invoice, etc.); b) other border crossing documents, which accompany the goods passed over the customs border of the Republic of Moldova (for example, the registration certificate of the means of transport).\nBy \"means of customs identification\" we mean any non-documentary sources of information regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the goods passed over the customs border of the Republic of Moldova: seals, stamps; textual, numerical or other marking, identification signs; proofs and samples of the goods; description of goods; sketches, images, photos, illustrations, etc. of goods etc.\n\"Non-declaration\" means not including in the customs declaration the information about the goods that had to be declared compulsorily. The order and manner of declaration are established by Section 27 of Chapter IV of the Customs Code.\n\"False declaration\" means the introduction of false information in the customs declaration.\nThe subject of the crimes analyzed is: 1) the responsible natural person who, at the time of committing the crime, reached the age of 16; 2) the legal person (except the public authority).\nIn the case of the offense provided for in paragraph (3) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, the subject can only be the person who has the obligation to pay the import duties on the goods under customs supervision, an obligation established by art. 1274 of the Customs Code.\nIn another register, regarding the aggravating circumstance recorded in letter a) paragraph (7) art. 248 of the Criminal Code - \"by two or more persons\".\nNext, we will analyze the aggravating circumstance recorded in letter b) paragraph (7) art. 248 HP RM.\nIn this case, the subject of the crime is, as the case may be:\n1) the responsible person;\n2) the person who manages a commercial, public or other non-state organization.\nPersons who do not possess such special qualities, but who took part in the commission of the crime together with the above-mentioned special subjects, must answer not as co-authors, but as organizers, instigators or accomplices of the crime provided for in letter b) paragraph (7) art. 248 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova.\nIn the sense of the provision from letter b) paragraph (7) art. 248 of the Criminal Code, by \"using the service situation\" is meant the commission of actions or inactions that arise from the work duties of the perpetrator and which are within the limits of his service competence. The use of the service situation can be expressed in the use, as the case may be, of: 1) information held by virtue of the service competence; 2) the meaning and authority of the position held; 3) hierarchical subordination to other persons, etc. At the same time, the notion of \"use of the service situation\" does not include the use of kinship, affinity or friendship relationships, when they are not related to the position held.\nThe subjective side of the offenses provided for in art. 248 of the Criminal Code is characterized by direct intent. Most often, the reason for these crimes lies in material interest. However, the presence of other reasons is not excluded: the intent of the perpetrator to ensure his own drug consumption; his intention to facilitate the commission of other crimes (for example, when the material object of the crime is: weapons or ammunition prohibited in the civilian circuit or subject to authorization; essential components of firearms; military devices; explosive, nuclear or radioactive materials, etc).\nThe preliminary actions in the documentation of crimes are expressed by:\n1) working mechanisms based on risk management, post-clearance audit, information systems that work online, which allow the rapid identification of cross-border criminal networks;\n2) unlimited access to the customs control area, unlike other legal bodies for which access to the respective area is limited by the normative acts in force;\n3) the possibility of receiving operatively from the customs bodies of neighboring states the necessary information regarding dubious external economic transactions.\nIn order to ensure compliance with customs legislation, to prevent fraud, the detection bodies apply various customs control procedures and tools.\nGoods and means of transport are subject to selective customs control. Selectivity provides that the customs authority uses, based on the risk analysis, those forms of control that are sufficient to ensure compliance with the legislation.\nThus, in the customs clearance process, customs control is applied according to the degree of risk determined by the \"ASYCUDA World\" information system, which leads to directing customs declarations to one of the customs control lanes (green, blue, yellow or red):\n- the green corridor – the granting of customs clearance without performing documentary and physical control;\n- the blue corridor – the granting of customs clearance without performing the documentary and physical control, with the subsequent control being performed based on the principle of selectivity through the reverification of the customs declaration;\n- the yellow aisle – performing the documentary control, without performing the physical control;\n- the red aisle - performing the documentary and physical control.\nI. Document control\nWhen performing the documentary control, the documents attached to the customs declaration are checked (at least the following mandatory documents: 1) the invoice; 2) transport documents; 3) permissive documents, necessary for granting customs clearance). At the same time, other documents can be additionally requested that confirm all the data indicated in the customs declaration and which are necessary for the granting of customs clearance.\nThe documentary control consists in verifying: the correctness of completing the customs declaration in detail; the existence of the documents attached to the customs declaration in detail, according to the requested customs destination; the agreement between the data entered in the customs declaration and those in the attached documents; the form of the attached documents.\n \nII. Physical control\nPhysical control consists in checking goods and means of transport with the aim of confirming information about the nature, origin, condition and quantity of the goods, the condition of seals, stamps and other means of identification.\nPhysical control can be carried out by: identifying goods, counting seats or parcels, weighing, measuring, photographing, taking samples and samples, applying special customs control equipment and other control tools in order to confirm the data indicated in the customs declaration and/or in the accompanying documents.\nThe customs authority can apply the following types of physical customs control of goods:\n- partial (with the verification of a part of the cargo lot, sufficient to ensure compliance with customs legislation);\n- total (with verification of the entire cargo lot). It applies, in particular, in situations where there are solid indications of non-compliance with the customs legislation in force or when the selectivity criterion expressly indicates the need to check the entire batch of goods, as well as in cases where, based on the risk analysis, it has been established that a partial control will not be sufficient to ensure compliance with customs legislation;\n- carried out in order to take samples and samples for the research (expertise) of the goods.\nThe declarant and other holders of rights over goods and means of transport, as well as their representatives, are obliged to assist in the control of goods and means of transport and to help the customs authority in carrying out the control.\nThe declarant or his representative is obliged, at the request of the customs body, to handle, unpack and repack the goods, without causing their degradation. The expenses related to these operations will be covered by the declarant.\nIf the declarant does not appear within 10 days from the presentation of the goods or the control cannot be postponed for security reasons or due to other circumstances that cannot be postponed, the customs will carry out the control in the absence of the declarant, but in the presence of persons not interested in the result the control.\nWhen carrying out customs control, technical means of control can be applied that do not pose any danger to the health and life of people, animals and plants and that do not cause damage to goods and means of transport. Customs has an arsenal of non-intrusive customs control equipment (scanners, located at the car border posts, at the airport and, in the near future, at the railway).\nCustoms also has customs laboratories, including mobile laboratories, which are used for the purpose of physical-chemical analysis of the goods, necessary to verify the correctness of the goods declaration. The customs laboratory is accredited for several tests and specializes in the fields of textiles, alcohol, petroleum products, food products.\nThe customs control is carried out in no more than 5 calendar days from the moment of receipt of the declaration and the information necessary for the customs control or, in case of physical control, from the moment of their presentation to the customs authority. For goods required in case of natural calamity, catastrophe or accident, as well as in the case of live animals, easily perishable goods, radioactive substances, mass information materials, the duration of customs control is limited to 3 days.\n \nIII. Subsequent control (post-clearance audit and reverification of customs declarations)\nThe subsequent control activity can be carried out by post-clearance audit or by re-verification of customs declarations.\nThe main objectives of the subsequent control are:\n- to help operators to overcome system errors and any deficiencies in understanding customs regulations;\n- to verify the correctness and completeness of the data entered in the customs declarations; to verify whether the obligation to declare the goods or to provide information has been fully complied with; to check whether the regulations related to customs regimes have been correctly applied;\n- to identify errors, detect violations of regulations or cases of fraud.\nThe investigation of smuggling crimes often goes beyond the borders of the state, having a transnational character.\nIn this sense, Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Law no. 371/2006 on international legal assistance in criminal matters, regulate the institution of international legal assistance in criminal matters and, in particular, the request for rogatory commission, as being the most used form.\nIn order to effectively investigate smuggling crimes, the emphasis is placed on collaboration with other institutions, which becomes essential for solving cases.\nThus, the institutions within the public administration authorities are repositories of data, information and documents that can contribute to the criminal investigation in order to establish the circumstances and resolve the case in all aspects.\nGovernment institutions can provide useful information about the persons under investigation, their relatives, associated persons and companies, finally they can help to identify assets and potential witnesses, as well as to draw up a thematic and financial profile.\nIn conclusion, we can mention that smuggling is one of the most serious acts likely to be committed in the sphere of customs legal relations, because, by committing it, social values of maximum importance for public order and, accordingly, for the legitimate and legal interests of citizens of the Republic of Moldova and foreigners under the jurisdiction of our state. At the same time, the state has the obligation not to let the rights and freedoms of the citizens in the customs territory of the Republic of Moldova be exposed to any damage derived from committing the act of smuggling.\nSmuggling and tax evasion harm the international society as a whole, by reducing budget receipts, which implicitly leads to the insufficient financing of the social and economic policies of the state, but also to the practice of unfair competition and the distortion of the business environment, for these reasons the Customs Service of the Republic Moldova makes maximum effort to combat smuggling crimes.\n\n\n\n\nSection 9 National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs\nGeneral\nThe Harmonized System, HS, nomenclature allows to identify precisely your product and check what tariff lines and rules apply. It is a logical structure to classify goods, used uniformly by customs authorities around the world.\nThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), commonly referred to as the Harmonized System, is an international system to classify goods developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). It is a broad classification system of around 5,000 six-digit product categories organized in a hierarchical structure by sections:\n•        chapters (2 digits)\n•        headings (4 digits)\n•        sub-headings (6 digits)\n•        and supported by implementation rules and explanatory notes.    \nIt allows economic operators, custom officials and legislators from any country to identify the same product by means of a numeric code.\nCountries use the HS system as a basis for customs tariffs and the collection of statistical data. They further sub-divide the six-digit HS product categories into eight or more tariff lines for greater specificity. The European Union uses eight-digit codes.\nHow is the HS nomenclature structured?\n•        21 major sections\n•        97 chapters (2 digits)\n•        headings (4-digit code)\n•        sub-headings (6-digit code)\n•        5,000 commodity groups\nExample of product classification\n•        section II vegetable products\no  chapter 07 edible vegetables and certain roots and tubers\n§ heading: 0705 lettuce (lactuca sativa) and chicory (cichorium spp.), fresh or chilled\n·        lettuce\no  sub-heading 070511: cabbage lettuce (head lettuce)\no  sub-heading 070519: other\n·        chicory\no  sub-heading 070521: witloof chicory (chicorium intybus var. foliosum)\no  sub-heading 070529: other\nNotes on the HS nomenclature\n•        almost all countries in the world share the same interpretation for HS codes\n•        the system is used by more than 200 countries and economies as a basis for their customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics - over 98% of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the HS\n•        HS codes are constantly updated to reflect changes in technology and the emergence of new products - the most recent amendment came into force in 2022, thus the current version is named HS Nomenclature 2022 edition[14]\n•        in practice, however, some countries might adapt their procedures and legislation at different times - this sometimes leads to temporary inconsistencies\n•        the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union (EU) is the EU's eight-digit coding system, comprising the HS codes with further EU subdivisions and legal notes specifically created to address the needs of the EU[15]\n\n\n[14] https://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs-nomenclature-2022-edition/hs-nomenclature-2022-edition.aspx\n[15] Source: https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/ro/content/sistemul-armonizat-0\n\n\n9.1. The essence of the National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs\nThe combined nomenclature of goods (Law no. 172/2014)[16] which is in accordance with the International Convention on the Harmonized System of Description and Coding of Goods of June 14, 1983, approved by the World Customs Organization, to which the Republic of Moldova is party (Law no. 112-XV /22 April 2004[17]) and it is applied throughout the customs territory for the purpose of:\n•        the uniform codification of goods introduced into and/or removed from the territory of the country, as well as placed in certain regimes and customs destinations;\n•        the application of customs duties on the import of goods;\n•        obtaining a statistic of the country's foreign trade.\nThe combined nomenclature of goods was developed in accordance with the requirements of international practices, considering the changes made in the Harmonized System of description and coding of goods, approved by the World Customs Organization.\nThe combined goods nomenclature is divided into 21 major sections and 99 chapters, with explanatory notes for each chapter, also the tariff code is composed from 9 digits: 6 digits according to the Harmonized System plus 3 digits additional for the national level for subheadings.\nThe amount of customs duties, as well as the list of goods subjects to them, related to each separate tariff position, is approved by the Parliament.\nThe rates of the customs duty are unique and cannot be changed, except for the cases stipulated by the legislation and the international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is party.\nThe following chapters of goods are defined by the national commodity nomenclature of foreign economic activity:\n\n\nSECTION I   LIVE ANIMALS;

Rules for determining commodity codes\nThe classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature of goods is carried out in accordance with the following rules:\n1. The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions.\n2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.\n(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3.\n3. When, by application of rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be affected as follows:\n(a) the heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods;\n(b) mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, in so far as this criterion is applicable;\n(c) when goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\n4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.\n5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein:\n(a) camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing-instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character;\n(b) subject to the provisions of rule 5 (a), packing materials and packing containers (1) presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule, the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n\n9.3. Preliminary tariff decisions\nPreliminary tariff decision - decision regarding the classification of goods issued exclusively by the Customs Service, prior to their customs clearance, binding for the territorial customs bodies and the owner, when the conditions of the Order of Customs Service no. 296/2016 [18]regarding the approval of the Regulation regarding the goods classification decision, are respected.\nAs part of an expected import or export operation, the interested parties have the right to request the Customs Service to issue the prior tariff decision on the classification of the goods (hereinafter the prior tariff decision). The request for issuing the prior tariff decision is made in writing form to the head office of the Customs Service.\nThe request regarding the issuance of the preliminary tariff decision must refer to a single type of commodity (same commercial name, brand, model, etc.). The documents and information necessary for the classification of the goods will be attached to the request, which will contain the following data:\na)     the owner's name/designation, domicile/headquarters and contact telephone number;\nb)     the applicant's name/designation, domicile/headquarters and contact telephone number if he is not the owner;\nc)     the detailed description of the goods that will allow its identification and classification according to the Combined Nomenclature of the goods;\nd)     the composition of the goods and the examination methods applied to establish them, if the classification depends on them;\ne)     the samples, photos, plans, catalogs or any other documents in the state language that may be useful to the Customs Service in determining the goods code according to the Combined Nomenclature of goods (to be attached as annexes to the request);\nf)      the product code according to the applicant's opinion;\ng)     any data to be considered confidential;\nh)     acceptance that the information provided be registered in a database of the Customs Service and as elements of the prior tariff decision, including any photo, sketch, brochure, etc. to be public, with the exception of information indicated by the applicant as confidential, for which the provisions of Law no. 171-XIII/1994 regarding commercial secrecy;\ni)      information about requests submitted to the Customs Service or prior tariff decisions issued for identical or similar goods, if the applicant has such information;\nj)      the act confirming the right of representation, if the applicant is different from the holder.\nThe preliminary tariff decision is issued in two copies. One copy is given to the holder or applicant, and the second copy is kept in the file of the Customs Service and is used for record purposes. Its validity period is 3 years.\nIn the process of customs clearance of the goods, the presentation of the preliminary tariff decision will be ensured in the original by the owner (declarant) or his representative (customs broker). The copy of the preliminary tariff decision is attached to the documents related to the transaction.\nThe holder applies the preliminary tariff decision only if he proves that the declared goods comply in all respects with those described in the decision.\n\n\n[18] https://www.legis.md/cautare/getResults?doc_id=136668&lang=ro#\n\n\nAt the same time the Customs Service keeps the record of all the issued preliminary tariff decisions, but the current available decisions are publicly accessible on the website: https://trade.gov.md/ro/articles/informatii-privind-deciziile-tarifare-prealabile-emise/ in order to help the interested parties to classify their closely related goods.\n\n\nSection 10 Control lists\n10.1. Structure of the national control lists\nMoldova has as reference the EU Control Lists such as: List of Dual-Use Items[19] and the Common Military List of the European Union[20], which is based on multilateral export control regimes such as The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), for the control of nuclear related technology, The Australia Group (AG) for control of chemical and biological technology that could be weaponized, The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) for the control of rockets and other aerial vehicles capable of delivering WMD.\nConsidering the Nomenclature of the strategic goods that are the subject of the control list, dual-use goods are classified in categories, regulated by the Government Decision No. 606 from 2002.\nThe list of materials, devices, equipment and information relevant to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices has been developed by NARNRA and published as Annex no. 2 to Law no. 132 from 2012.\nAccording to art. 32 let. c. (2) of Law no. 132/2012, the import, export, re-export, transit, temporary admission or temporary export of nuclear material are prohibited without the authorization of the NARNRA and of the authorized public authorities. The NARNRA website does not present statistical data on the issuance of radiological authorizations for types of activity import /export, temporary admission or temporary export and delivery of radioactive sources, transit of radioactive materials (Article 19, let. d, e, Law no. 132/2012). NARNRA is responsible (Chapter VI, Law no. 132/2012; Government Decision no. 152/2014) of the record of compliance with the provisions of the NPT and the Agreement on the Application of Nuclear Safeguards in relation to the NPT and the Protocol to this Agreement, bat NARNRA web site does not present annual export data for dual-purpose proliferation goods.\nData on the volume of dual-use goods can be checked in the statistical yearbook of the National Bureau of Statistics provided the domains and type of goods that are known. These data can also be consulted at the Customs Service, the Ministry of Economy and Digitalization (the former authority responsible for issuing export licenses for strategic goods), also at the Agency of Public Services.\n\n\n[19] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32021R0821\n[20] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XG0313%2807%29\n\n\n\n\nPART I List of Dual-Use products and Technologies\nThis list of dual-use items is understood to be items including software and technology that are suitable for both civil and military use. This handbook refers to dual-use “goods” instead of “items”, but what is important is that this refers to dual-use goods as well as software and technology.\nExport control on dual-use goods aims to prevent certain goods normally used for civil purposes, from being employed in the development and manufacture of weapons, in particular weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical weapons, biological) and missiles capable of delivering these weapons to their targets.\nInitially, multilateral export control regimes such as NSG, AG and MTCR, and the Wassenaar Arrangement, decide which goods are dual-use goods. In addition, certain chemicals are subject to controls in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n\nCode\n\n\t\n\nCategory\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nNuclear materials, facilities and equipment\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nSpecial materials and related equipment\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\t\n\nMaterials processing\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nElectronics\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nComputers\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nTelecommunications and \"information security\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\t\n\nSensors and lasers\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\t\n\nNavigation and avionics\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\t\n\nMarine\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\t\n\nAerospace and propulsion\n\n \nDefined Terms\nThroughout the Dual Use List, certain words take specific meanings. These are identified as defined terms.\nDefined terms that are used in more than one entry are identified with “double quotes” around them. The definition can be found at the beginning of the List.\nDefined terms that only appear in one entry have ‘single quotes’ around them and are defined within that entry under a ‘Technical Note.’\nExamples: \n\"Information security\" is all the means and functions ensuring the accessibility, confidentiality or integrity of information or communications, excluding the means and functions intended to safeguard against malfunctions. This includes \"cryptography\", \"cryptographic activation\", 'cryptanalysis', protection against compromising emanations and computer security.\n\"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\" (\"UAV\") means any aircraft capable of initiating flight and sustaining controlled flight and navigation without any human presence on board.\n\"Development\" is related to all phases prior to serial production, such as: design, design research, design analyses, design concepts, assembly and testing of prototypes, pilot production schemes, design data, process of transforming design data into a product, configuration design, integration design, layouts.\n\"Production\" means all production phases, such as: construction, production engineering, manufacture, integration, assembly (mounting),\ninspection, testing, quality assurance.\n\"Use\" means operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul and refurbishing.\nControl Language\nThe term ‘specially designed or modified’ is used widely in the control list:\n‘Specially designed’ means the item was designed solely for a certain purpose.\nThe Dual use list is a “positive list” compared to the military list  is a negative list; i.e., a military item is controlled unless there is an exemption.\nExample for ‘Specially designed’:\n0B005 Plant specially designed for the fabrication of ″nuclear reactor″ fuel elements and specially designed or prepared equipment therefor.\nNote:\nA plant for the fabrication of ″nuclear reactor″ fuel elements includes equipment which:\na.      Normally comes into direct contact with or directly processes or controls the production flow of nuclear materials;\nb.     Seals the nuclear materials within the cladding;\nc.      Checks the integrity of the cladding or the seal; or\nd.     Checks the finish treatment of the sealed fuel.\nGeneral Notes\nFour types of Notes to the Dual-use Control list:\n·        General Notes\n·        Nuclear Technology Note (NTN)\n·        General Technology Notes (GTN)\n·        General Software Notes (GSN).\n“Principal Element Note”\n·        Defines control status of listed components as part of unlisted goods\n·        Controlled when “Principle Element” and “easily removable”\nNote stating that the list also includes “used goods”\n„Nuclear Technology Note (NTN)”\n·        Valid for Category 0 (special nuclear goods)\n·        Defines wide control as “technology directly associated with”\n·        Decontrol for “public domain” and “basic scientific research\n„General Technology Note (GTN)”\n·        Valid for Categories 1 to 9\n·        Defines control as “technology required for” (key technology)\n·        Decontrol for “public domain”, “basic scientific research” and “patent applications”.\n„General Software Note (GSN)”\n·        Decontrol for “public domain”\n·        Decontrol for specific “mass market software” (not valid for Cat. 5, Part 2 “Information\n·        Security”; in Cat. 5, Part 2 the “Cryptography Note” decontrols specific “mass market goods”)\nNotes (Three types of Notes are used in the lists):\n1.     Note – Generally used to clarify the control status and, in most cases, to remove items from control\n2.     Technical Note – Used to expand on the meaning of the control and often to explain terms in a control entry\nExample: A Technical Note usually defines a word in the control text:\n2A226 Valves having all of the following characteristics:\na.      A ’nominal size’ of 5 mm or greater;\nb.     Having a bellows seal; and\nc.      Wholly made of or lined with aluminum, aluminum alloy, nickel, or nickel alloy containing more than60 % nickel by weight.\nTechnical Note: For valves with different inlet and outlet diameters, the ’nominal size’ in 2A226 refers to the smallest diameter.\n \n3.     N.B. – Used as a “signpost” to direct the user to a different area of the control list\nExample: A N.B. clarifies the control status and usually points to another entry that should be considered\n2B004 Hot \"isostatic presses\" having all of the following, and specially designed components and accessories therefor:\nN.B.: See also 2B104 and 2B204\n„In the public domain” \nIt refers to “technology” or “software” which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination.\nNote: Copyright restrictions do not remove “technology” or “software” from being “in the public domain”.\n \nThe dual-use list is very technical and a certain degree of technical knowledge is necessary in order to navigate through the list. An understanding of the defined terms and control language is important in order to understand which items are subject to list-based controls. Users of the Control List focus on the entry that specifies their items, but all Notes need to be considered to arrive at a proper classification.\nPART II List of Military products\nThe military goods are a translation of the internationally agreed Munitions List of the Wassenaar Arrangement. Examples of military goods are weapons, weapons systems, technology and software for such systems and other equipment designed specifically for military purposes. These goods are subdivided into items ML1 to ML22.[21] These 22 items give detailed descriptions of military goods, generally including accessories and/or components and related equipment. A brief description of the categories is given below.\n\n\n[21]Common Military List of the European Union (europa.eu)\n\n\n\nML1\n\n\t\n\nSmooth-bore weapons with a caliber of less than 20 mm, other arms and automatic weapons with a caliber of 12.7 mm (caliber 0.50 inches) or less and accessories\n\n\n\n\nML2\n\n\t\n\nSmooth-bore weapons with a caliber of 20 mm or more, other weapons or armament with a caliber greater than 12.7 mm (caliber 0.50 inches), projectors and accessories\n\n\n\n\nML3\n\n\t\n\nAmmunition and fuse setting devices, as follows, and specially designed components\n\n\n\n\nML4\n\n\t\n\nBombs, torpedoes, rockets, missiles, other explosive devices and charges and related equipment and accessories, and specially designed components\n\n\n\n\nML5\n\n\t\n\nFire control, and related alerting and warning equipment, and related systems, test and alignment and countermeasure equipment, specially designed for military use, and specially designed components and accessories\n\n\n\n\nML6\n\n\t\n\nGround vehicles and components\n\n\n\n\nML7\n\n\t\n\nChemical or biological toxic agents, \"riot control agents\", radioactive materials, related equipment, components and materials\n\n\n\n\nML8\n\n\t\n\n\"Energetic materials\", and related substances\n\n\n\n\nML9\n\n\t\n\nVessels of war (surface or underwater), special naval equipment, accessories, components and other surface vessels\n\n\n\n\nML10\n\n\t\n\n\"Aircraft\", \"lighter-than-air vehicles\", Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(\"UAVs\"), aero-engines and \"aircraft\" equipment, related equipment, and components, specially designed or modified for military use\n\n\n\n\nML11\n\n\t\n\nElectronic equipment, \"space craft and components, not specified else where in the present List\n\n\n\n\nML12\n\n\t\n\nHigh velocity kinetic energy weapon systems and related equipment and specially designed components\n\n\n\n\nML13\n\n\t\n\nArmored or protective equipment, constructions and components\n\n\n\n\nML14\n\n\t\n\n'Specialized equipment for military training' or for simulating military scenarios, simulators specially designed for training in the use of any firearm or weapon specified by ML1 or ML2, and specially designed components and accessories\n\n\n\n\nML15\n\n\t\n\nImaging or countermeasure equipment, specially designed for military use, and specially designed components and accessories therefor\n\n\n\n\nML16\n\n\t\n\nForgings, castings and other unfinished products, specially designed for items specified by ML1 toML4, ML6, ML9, ML10, ML12 or ML19\n\n\n\n\nML17\n\n\t\n\nMiscellaneous equipment, materials and libraries and specially designed components\n\n\n\n\nML18\n\n\t\n\nProduction equipment and components\n\n\n\n\nML19\n\n\t\n\nDirected Energy Weapon(DEW) systems, related or countermeasure equipment and test models and specially designed components\n\n\n\n\nML20\n\n\t\n\nCryogenic and \"superconductive\" equipment and specially designed components and accessories\n\n\n\n\nML21\n\n\t\n\n\"Software\"\n\n\n\n\nML22\n\n\t\n\n\"Technology\"\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2. How to find the item in the control list\n\n\n\n\nHow to check if an item is on the list?\nThe easiest way is to find the categories that at first sight seem most relevant. You may for example carry out a full-text search for words or distinctive features that characterize the items you want to look into.\n \nYou may carry out a full-text search by clicking Ctrl-F and then write the search term in the window that opens. To find the term in other places on the control list, please click “previous” or \"next\".\nControlled items are identified with a five-digit control number, called Dual-Use Goods Control Classification Number. The first digit is an indication of the category, the second digit indicates the group, and the last three digits indicate the type of control or the regimes under they falling into (regimes were described in the first chapter). The following are examples of controlled items, and the control numbers that apply to them:\n\n\n\n\nDU item no. 9A112 \"Unmanned aerial vehicles\"(\"UAVs\"), other than those specified in 9A012, as follows –\nHS code 8806 22 900 Unmanned aircraft, with maximum take-off weight more than 250 g but not more than 7 kg\nDU item no. 6A005 – \"Lasers\", other than those specified in 0B001.g.5. or 0B001.h.6., components and optical equipment, as follows\nHS code 9013 20 000 Lasers, other than laser diodes\nDU item no. 8A002 Marine systems, equipment and components\n(j.) Air independent power systems specially designed for underwater use –\nHS code 8421 39 25 – Machinery and apparatus for filtering or purifying air.\n \nDU item no. 2B350 Chemical manufacturing facilities, equipment and components (g.) Valves and components – HS code 8481 10 Pressure-reducing valves\n\n\n10.3. How to use the correlation table\nWhat is the Dual-Use Correlation table[22]?\nIt is a tool, that comes additionally to help interested parties to find the bond between the codes from the Dual Use control list (that were mentioned above) and the codes from Combined Nomenclature of the Harmonized System. Until now in the Republic of Moldova does not exist an official document that would have this type of information. Usually it is used the European version of it, as an additional source of information, for double-checking (in the case of customs declarations or authorizations etc).\n\n\n22] https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/0e5f18c2-4b2f-42e9-aed4-dfe50ae1263b/library/c3d06bd7-6ef0-4771-bbd7-f92b976ae9a0?p=1&n=10&sort=modified_DESC available source of the official EU Correlation table (version January 23)\n\n\n\nHS\n\n•        Used for many purposes – taxes, trade policies, rules of origin, tariffs, trade statistics, quota controls, economic research and analysis, etc. \n\n•        Classifies all merchandise in trade\n\n•        The HS code alone cannot identify goods as strategic.\n\n\t\n\nControl Lists\n\n•        Used to control trade in dual-use items\n\n•        Narrowly identifies goods ‘specially designed’ or meeting certain technical specifications required for applications of concern\n\n\n\nWhat are the main differences between the HS and Control Lists?\n\n\nIn general, it is necessary to see and to understand a few simple things about the above-mentioned correlation table:\n-         It is not mandatory to be strictly respected (namely, there are some exceptions where the codes do not necessarily coincide, because the list or nomenclature is not updated or for other reasons);\n-         Has an advisory character;\n-         One DU code can be assigned to several HS codes and vice versa;\n-         \n\n\nThe HS code includes both common goods that are not the subject to control and controllable goods.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the correlation table is helpful, numerous challenges arise:\n-         Some controls do not identify specific goods\n-         Some controls identify several kinds or multiple forms of goods\n-         Some controls are narrowly defined based on technical specifications not used in the HS\n-         Some controls are overlapping such that a commodity falling under a certain HS code could fall under various controls depending on technical specifications\n-         Some controls apply to goods not included in the HS\n-         Structural incompatibilities between the two systems\n-         Errors in existing correlation table\n-         Technology controls don’t correlate to the HS\nAt the same time there is a possibility to check on the goods which are going on the import or export on the official web page https://trade.gov.md/ro (see how it looks below), which allows to identify the necessity of presenting permissive acts or other documents at the clearance, at the same time, it allows you to understand the nature of the goods that you are going to use in future transactions. This additional tool, which uses keywords or tariff codes as a basis, can guide in the case of strategic goods on the need to present additional documents, but, again, it should be mentioned that, it is not always necessary to present additional documents (in case the technical specifications of the good do not correspond with requirements of the goods of the control list). \n\n\n10.4.

Permitted goods that were introduced/take out based on the permissive acts\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nThe corrosion-resistant, heat-resistant alloy ХН73МБТЮ (ЭИ698) is used in the aviation industry. The long-term operating temperature of nickel-plated steels is 750-800 degrees, depending on the shape of the manufactured parts\nCode DU: 1C002 HS: 7502 20 000\nExample 2:\nAgro drones capable of lifting 30 liters of spray solution, with wide transmission capabilities and centimeter-level precision positioning.\n \nCode DU: 9A112 HS: 8806 23\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nPN40 steel safety valve designed to protect installations against possible overpressures. It works automatically and closes when the pressure conditions return to normal. The safety valve 6302 is with spring and instant discharge, made of PN40 steel. As standard, it is delivered sealed with a closed lid, a sealing plug and a test lever. The seat and disc are heat strengthened, offering a high resistance to erosion.\nCode DU: 2B350 HS: 8481 10\n\n\nExample 4:\n\n\nCapacitors are electronic components that store and release electrical energy. They have various applications in electronic circuits, providing a range of functions.\nCode DU: 3A201 HS: 8532\n\n\nExample 5:\n\n\nThe modular respiratory protection product range comprises a versatile family of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) that can be rapidly sanitized and re-used for medical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and first responder environments. And with a wide selection of cartridges and filters, PAPRs can protect workers anywhere from industrial particulates up to noxious chemical gases, Coronavirus, and Tuberculosis.\nCode DU: 1A004 HS: 9020 00\n\n\n\n\nExample 6:\n\n\nSodium sulphide (CAS 1313-82-2)\nSodium Sulfide, Fused Flakes, also known as disodium sulfide, is used as an oxygen scavenger agent in water treatment as well as a metals precipitant. Ungraded products supplied by Spectrum are indicative of a grade suitable for general industrial use or research purposes and typically are not suitable for human consumption or therapeutic use but could also be used to create chemical weapons.\nCode DU: 1C350.50 HS: 2830 10\n\n\nExample 7:\nAlluminium Alloys - The use of aluminum as a material for mechanical and metal constructions is limited due to its low resistance properties. however, a number of the properties of aluminum make this metal particularly appreciated for a number of applications. Thus, the high plasticity of aluminum allows to obtain from it-! through plastic deformation very thin products like the foils used for packaging in the food industry\"! the high electrical conductivity 65% of that of copper determines that aluminum is widely used as a material for electrical conductors\"! high resistance to corrosion allows the use of aluminum in the chemical and food industry. Aluminum is used on a large scale as the basis for an important series of alloys.\nCode DU: 1C002 HS: 7601 20\n\n\n11.2.

General\nAn overview of international legislation in the area of customs clearance and customs control of dual-use goods envisages the definition of the main tools (international rules, agreements conventions etc.) intended to ensure an effective regulation of international trade procedures as well as to unify customs rules and appropriate procedures at state borders and harmonize the system of the international customs community.\nOver the past years, there were determinant trends in the international law of unifying customs procedures and bringing them into compliance with the unified international standards. Traditionally, the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the World Trade Organization have been the bodies responsible for these processes. These organizations ensure the development of “universal” international legal rules and recommendations for simplification of customs procedures that are taken into consideration and suggested for implementation in customs national laws of the world community.\nOne of such program documents drafted by the World Customs Organization is the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (of 05/18/1973). Ukraine acceded to this Convention as revised and updated on October 5, 2006. The Convention entered into force in Ukraine on September 15, 2011.\nAside from that, a number of other international agreements have been signed over decades. The agreements aim to eliminate complications and barriers in passing customs clearance procedures and establish some fundamental rules of the principal elements in the national customs procedures: customs control, customs clearance, collection of taxes and duties established by national legislation. However, there are problems of customs clearance and control over dual-use goods using the export control procedures. These problems are governed by the following international legal acts, including:\n- UN Security Council Resolution 1540;\n- Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the “NPT”);\n- Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the “CWC”);\n- Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (the “BTWC”).\n\n\n1.1.1 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.\n \nThe Resolution was approved on April 28, 2004, in the context of problems of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In accordance with para 3 of the Resolution, all states shall take effective measures to establish national control to prevent proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as their means of delivery, including the establishment of proper controls over related materials and, to this end, they shall, in particular:\n- establish, improve, review and maintain proper and effective controls at the national level over exports and cross-border movement of such items, including proper laws and regulations on control over exports, transit, cross-border movement and re-export as well as control measures over the provision of means and services pertaining to such exports and cross-border movement, for example, funding and transportation that would facilitate the proliferation. The states shall also establish measures of control over the end consumer and establish and apply proper criminal and civil sanctions for violating such laws and regulations in the field of export control (para 3 (d)).\nParagraph 10 of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 calls on all states to apply joint efforts, in accordance with their systems of legal regulation and legislation and in accordance with international law, to prevent illegal circulation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery and related materials.\nLater, the topic of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was continued and developed in the following UN Security Council Resolutions: 1673(2006), 1810 (2008), 1887 (2009), 1977 (2011), 2055(2012) and 2325(2016)[23].\n\n\n\n\nSee the details at the following link: http://www.un.org/ru/sc/1540/resolutions-committee-reports-and-SC-briefings/security-council-resolutions.shtml\n\n\nThe international export control regimes are the international organizations that formulate the guidelines on control over international transfers of military-purpose and dual-use goods as well as over non-proliferation of goods that may be used in the creation of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological) and missile means of delivery of such weapons: the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Zanger Committee (ZC), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and the Australia Group (AG).\n \nThe Zanger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group\nIn accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that entered into effect in 1968, the official nuclear states that is the states that officially had nuclear weapons became the USA, Great Britain, France, USSR and China. This Treaty asserted the principle of “non-transfer” of nuclear weapons to other states as well as counteraction to their production or purchase.\n\n\nOther states that are signatories to this Treaty have a “non-nuclear” status that implies an obligation not to buy and not to produce nuclear weapons as well as to establish Atomic Energy Agency (the “IAEA”) control over all peaceful nuclear activities.\n\n\n(Ukraine acceded the NPT in 1994)  Initially, the NPT was effective for 25 years and, in April 1995, the States Parties extended it indefinitely.\nTo perform individual provisions of NPT, some member countries that have alike views have set up informal joint action groups to counteract the development of nuclear programs in certain countries and established two organizations: the Zanger Committee (the “ZC”) and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (the “NSG”).\nZC was established in 1974 after four years of discussions within a group of states on the topic of their obligations set forth in Article 3 of the NPT. The Committee is an unofficial entity and acts outside the scope of the NPT.\n\n\nUkraine is a member of the Zanger Committee and participates in its proceedings since 1996. Pursuant to Article 3.2 of the NPT, each Party undertakes not to supply: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the required safeguards of safe use. As NPT does not concern control over nuclear technologies directly, therefore the Zanger Committee undertook to determine the meaning of the wording “equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material.” \nThe Zanger Committee approved the “Trigger List” that the state parties shall use in their national export control systems. Due to such joint action, a list was drawn up of goods and technologies that are sensitive to proliferation of nuclear weapons and an agreement was reached concerning control over transfers of such goods following the mutually agreed guidelines.\n\n\nThe NSG was established in 1978 as an informal association of nuclear supplier countries (Great Britain, Canada, the USSR, the USA, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan) that reached an agreement on common export guidelines for “nuclear-sensitive” items and strived to prevent the acquisition of nuclear weapons by countries that are not designated by the NPT as nuclear. The guidelines are published in IAEA document INFCIRC/254. The NSG Guidelines and the technical list thereto cover industrial products that may be used to create nuclear weapons. Such guidelines and the annex thereto were first approved in 1992, which was a significant contribution to the international export control system.\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 48 countries participate in the Nuclear Suppliers Group international export control regime. Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Belarus, Bulgaria, Brazil, United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Iceland, Spain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Canada, China, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea (South), Russian Federation, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, United States of America, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Finland, France, Croatia , Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan. A European Union representative attends meetings of the regime as a permanent observer.\n\n\nAt present, thirty-nine states participate in the Zanger Committee, namely: Argentina Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea (South), Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nova Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. A European Union representative attends meetings of the regime as a permanent observer.\n \nMissile Technology Control Regime\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was founded by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States in 1987 as an informal regime by a bilateral exchange of diplomatic notes between the partners.\nThis regime was established to curb the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and of drone systems of delivery of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\nThis regime was established as an additional measure to the mechanisms envisaged by the NPT. At a meeting of 1992, the participants agreed to extend the scope of application of the MTCR to include missiles and drones capable of carrying chemical and biological weapons.\nSince 1995, Ukraine implements state export control procedures on the national level and the relevant goods lists envisioned by the guidelines of the regime. However, Ukraine actually became a member of this organization in 1998 only.\n\n\nUnder the MTCR, a mutually-agreed list is used of materials, equipment and dual-use technologies that may be used to create missiles.\nWith regard to the finished missile systems and facilities for their production (Category I on the List), the “refusal as a rule” principle is established. Transfers of separate systems of such missiles for their production may be performed only subject to the appropriate consultations with the partners.\nThe regime participants hold regular consultations with a view to ensuring the operation of the regime.\n\n\nThe MTCR list includes finished missile systems and drones capable of delivering destructive payload over 500 kg over a distance more than 300 km as well as production facilities for such systems. Aside from that, the list includes some sensitive materials and technologies that may be used to manufacture missiles with a radius over 300 km.\n\n\nThirty-five countries participate in the international Missile Technology Control Regime, namely: Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark, India, Ireland, Iceland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Poland, Portugal Republic of Korea (South), Russian Federation, United States of America, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Finland, France, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan.\n\n\n\n\nWassenaar Arrangement\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement is an international agreement reached to establish control over conventional armaments (military-purpose goods, the “MPG”) and the dual-use items related to them (the “DUI”).\n\n\nAn official announcement of the establishment of the Wassenaar Arrangement was made on December 19, 1995, after an appropriate meeting that was held at the highest level and was attended by 28 countries. This was a first multilateral regime that covered both conventional arms and sensitive dual-use items related to them.\nThe establishment of a new regime was officially declared in Hague.\nOn April 2-3, 1996, Argentina, the Republic of Korea and Romania joined the regime, and Bulgaria and Ukraine as founding members joined it on July 11-12, 1996.\n\n\nOfficially, the WA began functioning since July 1996 as a regime established by 33 states that reached a consensus concerning initial WA elements (the main WA document) and approved the decision on the introduction since November 1, 1996, at the national levels of Control Lists and information sharing procedures.\n\n\nThe press release emphasized the fact that this arrangement would not be targeted against any specific state or a group of states and would not prevent honest civil transactions. Also, it was emphasized in there that it would not interfere with the right of the states to buy legal means intended to ensure their self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, while the decisions to transfer or not to transfer any item would be a responsibility of each member state. \n\n\nThe WA has the following objectives: to foster regional security and stability, to promote transparent transfers of conventional arms and dual-use items related to them, to attain the assumption by the member states of the appropriate commitments regarding the procedures for transferring such goods. This organization promotes an increase in the level of cooperation among member states with a view to preventing the purchase of weapons and sensitive dual-use items for the purposes of military end use where the regional situation or actions of the country receiving these items causes serious concerns by WA member states.\n\n\nWA member states approved a document that sets the rules for exporting small arms and light weapons. These rules include the elements of the UN Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and of OSCE document of 2001 entitled “Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons.”\nRecognizing the threats posed by unauthorized proliferation and use of Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS), especially to civil aviation, peacekeeping, crisis management and counter-terrorism operations, the WA member states apply strict national controls over MANPADS exports since 2000.\nThese controls are based on the document “Export Control Elements of Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS)” approved by WA Plenum.\nThe supplemented the already existing international regimes of control over non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (the “WMD”).\nControl over international transfers of conventional armaments and dual-use items under the WA is exercised in accordance with the guidelines (Initial Provisions) and the approved lists of the relevant goods.\n\n\nThe states that acceded to the WA agreed to carry out a voluntary and confidential sharing of sensitive information on exports and imports of goods and hold consultations on the matters of transferring the MPG and certain categories of DUI as well as promote mutual understanding, given the possible risks of such transfers.\n\n\nAs part of their international commitments that arise from their participation in the WA, the participating states every six months post reports on transfers or refusals to transfer certain goods to the states that are not WA participants on the Regime Information System, namely:\nthe issued permits to export certain categories of conventional arms (these categories are reportable to the UN Register of Conventional Weapons, including small arms and light weapons) that have been included in the WA List of Military-Purpose Goods;\n\n\nthe issued permits or performed international transfers of “sensitive” and “very sensitive” goods included in the WA List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies;\nrefusals to issue permits for the transfer of goods included in the WA List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies;\nrefusals to issue permits to export “sensitive” and “very sensitive” goods included in the WA List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies;\nthe issued permits for the performance of essentially identical transfers of “sensitive” and “very sensitive” goods included in the WA List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies that had been an object of refusal by another participating state during the prior three-year period.\nLicensing procedures for international transfers of goods are performed pursuant to national laws of the Parties.\nThe WA foundations are the relevant control lists of military-purpose and dual-use goods.\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 42 countries participate in the Wassenaar Arrangement international export control regime. Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, India, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa Republic, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea (South), Russian Federation, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, United States of America, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden and Japan.\n \n\n\nAustralia Group\nThe basic documents in the field of non-proliferation of chemical and biological weapons are the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva Protocol), the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BWC) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (CWC).\nThe Geneva Protocol was entered into and signed in 1925 on the initiative of the League of Nations. It prohibited the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other similar gases as well as bacteriological means of warfare. The Protocol created an obstacle to using chemical and biological weapons but did not provide for a prohibition on developing, manufacturing and stockpiling such weapons of mass destruction. Later, negotiations concerning such types of weapons continued and resulted in the entry into international treaties on the prohibition of biological weapons of 1972 and on the prohibition of chemical weapons of 1992.\nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BWC) was opened for signature in 1972 and entered into effect in 1975. It was the first international document aiming to prevent proliferation of biological weapons. The participant countries of the Convention undertake not to develop, produce, buy and keep microorganisms that are especially dangerous for humans, animals and plants and that are not intended for peaceful use (conducting science research, implementing preventive, protection and other measures) as well as equipment and means of delivery that are intended for using such microorganisms in armed conflicts or in any illegal actions. Aside from that, the BWC provides for a destruction of the microorganisms, equipment and means of delivery that the participant state already has, which is the subject of the Convention, or a redirection of such biological material for peaceful use. Participant states also undertake not to transfer biological weapons and goods that may be used for their creation to other states and international organizations and not to aid in the purchase of such items, neither to encourage it. At the same time, they undertake to cooperate for peaceful purposes and observe the provisions of the Convention, while not restraining the economic and technological development of the state.\nThe BWC does not have provisions to prohibit new types of biological weapons that may result from the development of biotechnologies, genetic engineering, microbiology and other biological sciences. It means that it does not cover genetically modified organisms that have some changed characteristics which may be dangerous and therefore allow the use of these organisms in the creation of biological weapons.\nThe BWS has effect for an unlimited term but this international document has a lower effectiveness because it does not have a verification mechanism for compliance with the provisions of the Convention. Neither does it have a list of prohibited biological agents and goods that are subject to state control. In this connection, the Convention participants apply some effort to establish such a mechanism. Presently, the participant states have developed the so-called “trust measures.” The measures envision a voluntary annual provision by all participant states, including Ukraine, to the United Nations of information about their performance of the obligations provided by the BWC (about the works that are performed in the biological field, the publications, the programs, national legislation etc.).\nAs of April 2017, 178 countries were BWC participant countries. Six (mostly African) countries signed the Convention but not yet ratified it.\nIn 1992, the UN General Assembly approved draft Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (CWC) aiming to supplement the Geneva Protocol concerning a total prohibition of chemical weapons, inadmissibility of their proliferation and reproduction in the future. It was open for signature one year later. After the CWC was ratified by 65 states, the Convention entered into effect in 1997. Similar to the BWC, the Convention has legal effect indefinitely.\nPursuant to the Convention, it is prohibited to produce, possess and use chemical weapons. All participant states of the Convention are required to destroy their existing stocks of chemical weapons (if available). Enforcement of this prohibition and all the activities related to the destruction of chemical weapons are controlled by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (the “OPCW”), which was specifically established for this purpose and has its headquarters in Hague (the Netherlands).\nAdditionally, the Convention governs the production, processing and consumption of chemicals that are the substances categorized as chemical weapons as well as the substances that may be used in their production (these are the so-called dual-use chemicals that have a fully civil purpose). The said categories of chemicals are listed in the Chemicals Annex to the Convention. Depending on the hazard posed by the chemical, it is included in one of the three Chemicals Lists of the Annex:\nList 1 – the chemicals that had been used as chemical weapons in the past; they have a very limited peaceful use and pose a high level of hazard; they are subject to strict controls including the imposition of a restriction on the maximum volume of production;\nList 2 – the chemicals that are mostly precursors to the List 1 chemicals, most of them are used in industry and they pose a significant hazard in view of the objectives of the Convention;\nList 3 – the chemicals that pose a certain hazard because they also may be used in the production of chemical weapons, however, they are produced in large quantities for commercial purposes and are widely used in the chemical industry.\nThe OPCW also performs checks of production facilities and of the immediate production of chemical substances, where such chemical substances are of dual use and may be used in the creation of chemical weapons. A certain number of Ukrainian civil chemical industry facilities, which operations are regulated by the provisions of the Convention, is subject to OPCW inspections.\nIn accordance with the CWC requirements, government control shall cover transfers (both domestic and international) of the chemicals that are included in the Annex.\nThe participant states shall provide information about certain transfers of chemicals to the OPCW.\nThe CWC has an important provision envisaging international cooperation in the field of peaceful use of chemical substances.\nIt was planned to destroy chemical weapons during the 10 years after the Convention entered into effect, however, as some countries could not abide by this deadline, the participant states decided to extend it. In the near term, this task remains a priority, given the fact that the destruction of chemical weapons is carried out in violation of the established deadlines (mostly for economic reasons).\nBy the present time, the CWC has been ratified by most world countries (as of April 2017, there were 192 countries), including Ukraine that ratified the Convention in 1998.\n The so-called Australia Group (the “AG”) was established in 1985 for the participant countries to implement uniform rules of control over exports of goods that may be used in the creation of chemical or biological weapons, including “agents” and “precursors” of such weapons. The use of chemical weapons (the “CW”) during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 caused a great concern of the world community and served the main reason of creating Australia Group.\nThe participant states in this informal group cooperate on the matters of supporting and developing the national export control systems. This cooperation aims at preventing further export of chemical products that may be used or redirected for use under the programs of creating chemical or biological weapons.\nThe AG has approved the activities guidelines and a number of Lists that determine chemical precursors, biological substances, chemical and biological equipment of dual use as well as the relevant technologies. The participant states assumed political obligations to ensure national control over exports of the said products.\nSince 1997, Ukraine implemented the rules and lists recommended by this regime at the national level and, in April 2005, it acquired membership in the Australia Group regime.\nAs of April 2021, 42 countries participate in the Australia Group international export control regime. Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, India, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Norway , Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea (South), Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, United States, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan.\n\n\n1.2. A brief overview of national legislation\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 1 of the current Customs Code of Ukraine (the “Code,” the “CCU”), customs legislation of Ukraine consists of the “Constitution of Ukraine, this Code, other laws of Ukraine governing the matters listed in Article 7 of this Code, the international agreements of Ukraine ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine as well as of the regulations issued based on and in execution of this Code and other legislative acts.”\nThe central executive authority whose activities are directed and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and which implements the government customs policy in the field of fighting violations of legislation during the application of customs laws is the State Customs Service of Ukraine (the “State Customs”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSee the details on the tasks set before the State Customs Service in Section 2.2 of this Handbook.\n\n\n\nCustoms control and customs clearance of goods that are subject to state export control are governed by the provisions of the Customs and Tax Codes, laws and other legal and normative legal acts of Ukraine that regulate the issues of international transfers of goods that are subject to state export control and of the performance of customs control and customs clearance procedures.\n \n\n\t\n\nSee the detailed information on customs clearance of controlled goods in Section 2.4 of this Handbook.\n\n \nAdditionally, Article 197 of the Customs Code provides that in the cases provided by law, restrictions on the movement of certain goods across the customs border of Ukraine are established. The entry of such goods into the customs territory of Ukraine and/or their exit, depending on the requirements of relevant laws, shall be ensured by customs authorities based on the relevant authorization documents and/or information about the inclusion (deletion) of the relevant good in (from) the relevant register. Such documents shall have the form of electronic documents, authenticated by an electronic digital signature and shall be obtained from state authorities, other institutions and organizations authorized to exercise authorization or control functions with respect to moving goods across the customs border of Ukraine. Such documents are to verify the compliance with the established restrictions on the moving of such goods across the customs border of Ukraine, if the use of such authorization documents and/or information for the performance of customs formalities is provided by laws of Ukraine. \n\n\nHowever, part 2 of the said Article also establishes that the “State Customs Service of Ukraine shall determine the UKT ZED codes of the goods that are subject to a restriction on moving them across the customs border of Ukraine in the relevant direction. This authority shall post the relevant information on its official website and on the Single Window for International Trade single state web portal for information queries.\nWith regard to the above, customs authorities shall perform the formalities provided by law that are necessary for the passage across the customs border of Ukraine of goods nomenclature of dual use with full observance of regulations in the field of export control and interact in such a manner with the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine that is the specially authorized authority for the implementation of the state export control policy.\nIn accordance with Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of March 31, 2015, No. 159 “On Approving Regulation on the State Service on Export Control of Ukraine,” the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine (the “State Export Control”) is the central executive authority whose activities are directed and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine - Minister of Economy who is implementing the government policy in the field of government export control.\nThe legislative framework in the field of state export control is made up of the Constitution of Ukraine, other laws of Ukraine, acts of the President of Ukraine and of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, other normative legal acts as well as international agreements of Ukraine ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\nThe current list of regulations that determine the procedure for control over international transfers of dual-use items (military-purpose goods) is posted on the official website of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nIn the following chapters, we are going to consider legislative acts that establish customs control and customs clearance procedures for dual-use goods as part of export control procedures.\nThe main act of national legislation in this field is Law of Ukraine No. 549-IV of February 20, 2003, \"On State Control for International Transfer of Military and Dual-Use Goods” (the “Law No. 549-IV”).\nThis Law covers the activities related to international transfers of goods, including the provision of intermediary (brokerage) services, production, science and technical and other cooperation, demonstration of goods as exhibits at international trade shows and exhibitions for advertising purposes, performing tests, trade and their exchange transactions.\nAside from that, the Law provides a number of operations that are outside its scope of application, in particular, concerning the movement of goods in connection with measures taken by military units, law enforcement bodies, Ukraine’s civil defense bodies and units outside its borders or by military detachments of the armed forces of other states in the territory of Ukraine in accordance with international agreements of Ukraine, if they envision special mechanisms for control over movement of such goods; international transfers of gas-operated, sports or hunting weapons, weapons that are equipped with rubber or similar by their qualities projectiles that are non-lethal, other weapons that are covered by the authorization system for the circulation of such weapons as well as the component parts, bullets and ammunition for them etc.\nThe Law sets forth some terms that one must know when performing customs procedures with dual-use items, including:\ndual-use items shall mean individual types of articles, equipment, materials, software and technologies that are not specifically intended for military use as well as services (technical assistance) related to them which, apart from their civic use, may be used for military or terrorist purposes or for the development, production and use of military-purpose goods, of the weapons of mass destruction, the means of delivery of the weapons of mass destruction or nuclear explosive devices, including certain types of nuclear materials, chemical substances, bacteriological, biological and toxic preparations whose list shall be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine;\n- technical data – blueprints, plans, drawings, layout, diagrams, models, formulas, specifications, software, manuals and instructions on paper or other media, including electronic;\n- technical assistance – holding briefings and consultations, taking professional development and training measures as well as those to study the work methods in practice;\n- underlying technologies – the technologies that determine the principle of operation and use of equipment as well as technology elements without which military equipment cannot be created and used;\nstate export control shall mean a set of measures to exercise control over international transfers of goods and their use by the legal entity or individual that is exercised by the central executive authority implementing the government policy in the field of state export control and other state authorities with a view to safeguarding national security interests and in accordance with Ukraine’s international commitments;\nDuring 2018-2019, some changes were introduced to Ukrainian legislation that were intended to simplify customs control and customs clearance procedures for the business entities engaged in foreign economic activity by automating the mechanisms of declaring the goods using electronic services. For example, the Single Window mechanism was implemented in this context in the course of moving goods across the customs border of Ukraine as well as changes were introduced to the Customs Code of Ukraine and Law No. 549-IV.\n \n\n\t\n\nSee the detailed information on customs clearance procedures in Single Window regime in Section 3.2 of this Handbook.\n\n \nIn accordance with Article 21 of the Law, the customs authorities shall perform customs formalities required for the passage across the customs border of Ukraine and the placement under an appropriate customs regime of military-purpose and dual-use goods based on the appropriate authorization document for the performance of international transfers of goods obtained from the central executive authority implementing the government policy in the area of state export control using the Single Window mechanism.\nPart 3 of Article 21 provides that “at the request of the importer of the goods that may be submitted, in particular, using the Single Window mechanism, the customs authorities shall issue a delivery confirmation certificate that would attest to the fact of arrival in Ukraine of the goods specified in the said certificate. The applicant may choose the issuance of the delivery confirmation certificate in the paper format or as an electronic (scanned) copy of a paper document certified by the electronic digital signature using the Single Window mechanism.\nIt means that, starting April 2019, it is possible to submit the authorization document issued by the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine for the performance of international transfers of military-purpose and dual-use goods for customs clearance purposes only electronically, with a digital signature and using the Single Window facility only.\nHowever, presently work continues to improve normative and legal interaction between the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine and the State Customs Service, in particular, concerning a determination of the best mechanisms for the automated processing of information in the course of exercising control over the movement across the customs border of Ukraine of military-purpose and dual-use goods.\nIn accordance with Article 8 of the Law of Ukraine No. 549-IV, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine introduced the Procedure for State Control Over International Transfers of Dual-Use Goods (Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of January 28, 2004, No. 86 “On Approving the Procedure for State Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose Goods”).\nThe Procedure sets forth the procedures for the exercise of state control over international transfers of dual-use goods included in the Unified List of Dual-Use Goods and the goods not included in the Unified List of dual-use Goods in the cases provided by Article 10 of the Law of Ukraine “On Government Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose and Dual-Use Goods.”\nAn international transfer of goods may be performed by the business entity performing international transfers of goods or a foreign business entity, provided the latter has the appropriate authorization or a conclusion of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nThe authorization or a conclusion of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine entitling its holder to perform the relevant international transfer of any dual-use item, equipment or material shall be the ground to provide the importer (end consumer) with a set of technical documents (technical data) that are required to adjust, operate and use such goods to their intended purpose within the scope defined by this authorization or conclusion.\nDuring customs clearance of goods, the entity or foreign entity shall submit the relevant authorization or a conclusion of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine along with other documents necessary for the performance of customs control and customs clearance of goods in accordance with law.\nThe said Procedure does not permit exporting individual goods to the states subject to an export embargo on such goods imposed by the UN Security Council and also in the case where the results of an expert review in the field of state export control show that there are grounds to believe that the goods are intended for the following:\n- creation of the weapons of mass destruction or means of their delivery;\n- use for terrorist or other illegal purposes;\n- use as part of the activities related to the creation of nuclear explosive devices or as part of the activity related to the nuclear fuel cycle that is not subject to the IAEA Safeguards;\n- use as part of the activities related to the acquisition, creation, accumulation or application of chemical weapons as a means of warfare;\n- use in the activity related to the acquisition, creation, accumulation or application of the pathogens of diseases and toxins of both bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons or their components;\nThe relevant obligations concerning individual groups of dual-use items are specifically described in accordance with subparagraph 2 of paragraph 19 of this Procedure.\nIt is also worth noting that, on May 17, 2021, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved Resolution No. 482 “On the Introduction of Changes to the Procedure for Government Export Control over the Conduct of Negotiations Related to the Entry into Foreign Economic Agreements (Contracts) on the Export of Goods” that took effect on 06/20/2021.\nThis act was passed to bring the Procedure for Government Export Control over the Conduct of Negotiations Related to the Entry into Foreign Economic Agreements (Contracts) on the Export of Goods approved by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 06/06/2012 No. 500 into compliance with Article 18 of the Law of Ukraine \"On Government Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose and Dual-Use Goods,” Article 5 of the Law of Ukraine “On Sanctions” and to update the list of the participant states in international export control regimes and supplement the list of recommended clauses to include in foreign economic agreements (contracts) with special guarantees.\nToday Ukraine participates in all five active international export control regimes. In accordance with its obligations assumed under these regimes and approved control lists, Ukraine ensures proper control over international shipments of controlled goods, nuclear and special non-nuclear materials, equipment and facilities for their production as well as individual types of other materials, equipment, software and technologies that may be used in the creation of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices, materials, equipment and dual-use technologies that may be used in the creation of chemical and biological weapons.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2 Structure of the Customs Service and functions of its structural divisions\n\n\nThe customs policy, its formulation and implementation are an important element of state’s activities virtually at all stages of its development. To use the customs tool the most effectively, the customs system requires the establishment of a robust and effective management vertical that would primarily ensure state interests.\nAfter resigning from the USSR, Ukraine embarked on the path of an independent integration with the world community and with the world economic relations, aiming to take its own place amongst world countries. A refocusing towards the establishment of international cooperation required a reorganization and establishment of new state institutions and structures, harmonizing its peaceful sphere with the European principles.\nWhen a transition to market conditions occurs, a customs authority is a regulator of state relations under the conditions of transformation processes. A separate attention in the future was claimed by the performance of Ukraine’s commitments in the field of international export control arrangements and by the national interests of the state concerning the transfer of military-purpose and dual-use goods and technologies.\nAs of today, after passing several stages of establishment and reorganization, the State Customs Service of Ukraine is the authority that implements the customs policy of Ukraine. This is an aggregation of specially authorized executive authorities that protect the economic interests of the state by means of exercising customs control and customs clearance of goods that are moved across the border, levying customs duties, counteracting smuggling and violations of customs rules.\nOne may single out the following main fields of Ukraine’s customs policy:\n– developing the system of state regulatory bodies in the field of customs;\n– setting the amounts of duties and the conditions for charging those duties;\n– establishing free customs areas and customs regimes in the territory of Ukraine;\n– determining the list of goods that are prohibited to export, import and transit across the territory of Ukraine.\nThe following three main functions are entrusted to the bodies of the Customs Service of Ukraine:\n1.                  the fiscal function that is to collect duties on export and import transactions and the function of drawing up documents of legal entities and individuals that are subject to customs duties;\n2.                  information that envisages the collection and processing of information and dissemination of statistical data to the appropriate state entities;\n3.                  the law enforcement function that is carried out by fighting crime and, primarily, smuggling.\nAs such, the State Customs Service was established specifically to implement the customs policy as a component of the government policy, while using measures of tariff and non-tariff regulation provided by law. The State Customs Service is an integral part of the central executive authorities and is charged with the task of implementing the customs policy.\nGiven the utmost importance of customs policy for the state, the regulations provide that the highest bodies of state power and administration govern customs in Ukraine: the President of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. At the initial states of customs service development, the legislative and executive branches of power had the prerogative; however, at later stages the President of Ukraine now governs the State Customs Service of Ukraine.\nGiven any historical conditions of the existence of states and the differences in their forms of governance, political systems and regimes, customs has always been an obligatory attribute that played an important role in the mechanism of formulation and implementation of the customs policy of the state.\n \n2.1. Stages of development and establishment of customs in the independent Ukraine\nThe development of customs policy is related to the strategy of the state, its goals and objectives both in the external and domestic markets. When analyzing the development of customs and customs policy of the Ukrainian state, one must also understand the basis on which it was built after country’s independence.\nDuring the period of foreign economic reform (1986 – 1991), the USSR launched a new stage of development of state customs. Its peculiarities were related to an attempt to transform the old model of the state monopoly policy to a policy oriented at the economic model of regulating foreign trade under free market conditions. In March 1991, a new Customs Code of the USSR was approved that entered into effect on July 1 of the same year.\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine’s customs system inherited 26 customs offices and 49 customs stations (for comparison: after the completion of the first stage of customs development in Ukraine in 1996, the country already had 10 regional customs offices, 42 customs offices, 195 customs stations, 12 specialized customs institutions like the following: customs laboratories, educational institutions etc.).\nBy their organization and structure, five key stages of customs establishment in Ukraine may be singled out:\nStage I: development of the national customs system as part of activities of the State Customs Committee of Ukraine (1991-1996);\nStage II activities of the State Customs Service of Ukraine (1996—2012);\nStage III functioning of customs bodies within the structure of the Ministry of Revenue and Duties of Ukraine (2012—2014);\nStage IV reorganization of the Ministry of Revenue and Duties of Ukraine into the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine that included the customs authorities (2014—2019);\nState V: New customs (2019 to present).\nEach of these stages had its peculiarities that evidently were determined by approaches to state regulation of the economy sector, the domestic political situation in Ukraine, the priorities that businesses had regarding their foreign economic operations and the overall trends of market economy development. Let us mark some important developments that occurred during the mentioned stages.\nFor example, a landmark event in the history of domestic customs of independent Ukraine was the reorganization of the Department of State Customs Control under the Council of Ministers of the USSR and establishment on its basis of the State Customs Control Committee of Ukraine.\nDecember 11, 1991 The State Customs Control Committee of Ukraine is renamed to State Customs Committee of Ukraine and, in fact, becomes the first central executive authority of Ukraine in the customs field and is subordinated to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. June 25, 1991 The Verkhovna Rada of the USSR approves the Law “On Customs in the Ukrainian SSR” while the Customs Code of Ukraine takes effect on December 12, 1991.\nOn February 5, 1992, the Law of Ukraine “On Unified Customs Tariff” was approved and the customs tariff documents were drafted.\nAt Stage II, the State Customs Service of Ukraine was established (November 29, 1996) as a central executive authority. This stage of the functioning of the State Customs Service of Ukraine was characterized by an improvement in the organization structure, a refocusing from the territorial principle to the regional one, a reduction in the number of customs offices and customs stations (from 69 to 55 and from 268 to 199 respectively), the introduction of elements of customs risk management, the improvement of the information and analytical work in the customs field, the strengthening of customs control and the fight against smuggling, further development of the international field of work of customs authorities and the approximation of customs legislation to the European standards. In particular, on July 22, 2002, a new Customs Code was approved that enshrined the main provisions of a number of international conventions and agreements on customs in national legislation, including GATT/WTO.\nStructure and organization changes occurred within the system of customs authorities of Ukraine during 2012 – 2018. December 18, 2018 The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the State Tax Service (STS) and the State Customs Service (SCS) through a reorganization of the State Fiscal Service by dividing its functions. \nAt this stage, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, in October 2019, approved the regional structure of customs (by reducing the number of customs offices from 26 to 16) and approved the draft law that envisioned the incorporation of customs bodies as a single legal entity.\nIn July 2019, an action plan was approved for reforming the authorities implementing the tax and customs policies. The action plan envisaged an optimization of the structure, an improvement of procedures, the fostering of the use of information technologies and other tasks.\nOn June 30, 2021, as part of the implementation of the described plan, the State Customs Service of Ukraine issued Order No. 472 “On Beginning of the Exercise by Customs Offices as Detached Divisions of the State Customs Service of Ukraine of the Functions and Powers Charged With Them for Implementing the State Customs Policy and the State Policy in the Field of Fighting Violations of Law in the Course of Applying Customs Legislation.” This Order marked a transition by the Customs to carrying out its activities as a unified legal entity.\nThe creation and development of the customs policy of the Independent Ukraine resulted in the fact that today Ukraine, in carrying out its customs affairs, abides by the internationally recognized goods classification and coding systems as well as a unified format for declaring goods exports and imports, the methods of determining the customs value of goods, the customs statistics systems and other rules and standards generally accepted in the international practice.\n \n2.2. Peculiarities, objectives and tasks of customs in Ukraine\n \nCustoms Authorities of Ukraine\nCustoms Authorities of Ukraine are an aggregation of executive authorities that protect economic interests of Ukraine by exercising customs control and customs clearance of goods that are moved across the border, levy customs duties, counteract smuggling and violations of customs regulations.\nCustoms authorities aim to create favorable conditions for the development of foreign economic activity, ensure security of the society and protect customs interests of Ukraine.\nIn carrying out customs

Number of checkpoints and control points by category\nFigure 2. Number of checkpoints and control points by type of traffic\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Customs economic zones\n \nThe general concept of customs economic zones\nCustoms economic zones are widely created in the world practice. They are a limited territory with a special economic status as compared to the rest of the territory of the country. This is mainly manifested in a preferential treatment in terms of tax, customs, currency and financial conditions applicable to local entrepreneurs and companies as well as to foreign investors. Most frequently, such a zone is described by the term “free economic zone” (the “FEZ”) and is subject to a special management regime. Aside from that, this zone is singled out of the general customs border of the country. The typical features of most free economic zones are tax and customs benefits concerning the import duty, value added tax, profit tax, a fee payable to the employment fund, land use fees and the excise duty. Additionally, some improved customs procedures and a liberal foreign currency policy are envisaged.\nThe main reasons for the countries that create free economic zones to create them is the need to ensure favorable conditions for a targeted social and economic development, ensure an effective use of the beneficial transport, geographic and geopolitical location, furnishing a solution to the employment issues, and holding a local business experiment etc.\nFree economic zones are widely used in world business practices with a view to attracting investment and ensuring their effective use, activating entrepreneurship activities jointly with foreign investors aiming to increase goods exports, and shipments to the domestic market of high-quality products and services, implementing new technologies, developing the market infrastructure, improving the use of natural, physical and labor resources as well as speeding up social and economic development. By establishing free economic zones, governments expect investors to create new jobs, they also expect the exports to grow and the industrial infrastructure to build. Such expectations are often justified.\n \nFree economic zones in Ukraine\nAlmost immediately after Ukraine's independence and the passing in 1992 of the Law of Ukraine “On General Principles of Creation and Functioning of Special (Free) Economic Zones,” conditions for the functioning of free economic zones in Ukraine were created. Even today, the Law is the main state document in this field. The Law provides that a FEZ is a part of the territory of Ukraine, in which a special legal regime of economic operations is established and functioning as well as the procedure for applying legislation of Ukraine. The Law provides that privileged customs, tax, foreign currency and financial as well as other terms may be implemented of economic activities of the national and foreign investors.\nIn accordance with the above Law, the special (free) economic zones shall be established by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the initiative of the President of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine or local Councils of People’s Deputies of Ukraine and local state administrations. The status and territory of a (free) economic zone as well as the term for which it is created shall be established by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Operation of each FEZ is governed by a separate law.\nIn accordance with Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of March 14, 1994, No. 167 “On the Concept of Creating Special (Free) Economic Zones in Ukraine, the FEZ may be of the following types:\n-         foreign trade zones are a part of the territory of the state where foreign-origin goods may be stored, purchased and sold duty-free and without payment of customs fees or with their deferral;\n-         scientific and technical zones are the FEZ whose special legal regime is oriented at the development of the scientific and production potential and achieving the economy of a new quality through encouraging fundamental and applied research with a further implementation of scientific research results into production;\n-         tourist recreation zones are the FEZ that are set up in the regions with a rich natural, recreation and historical and cultural potential with a view to achieving their effective use and preservation as well as boosting entrepreneurship activities (including those that involve foreign investors) in the field of recreational and tourist business.\n-         bank and insurance (offshore) zones are the areas in which especially favorable treatment of bank and insurance transactions in foreign currencies is implemented to service non-residents;\n-         frontier trade zones are a part of the territory of the state at the border with neighbor countries where simplified procedures for border crossing and trade are applied.\nAs of 2021, there are 11 FEZ of different types in 58 cities of Ukraine. If one is to have no regard to the differences in their size, the terms of their functioning are very similar. The operations of most of them, however, are very scarce or have almost stopped.\n \nCustoms clearance in FEZ\nThe Customs Code of Ukraine provides that a free customs area shall be a customs regime under which foreign goods are brought into the territory of the free customs area and are brought out of this area beyond the boundaries of the customs territory of Ukraine free of customs payments and without application of measures of non-tariff regulation of foreign economic activities, while Ukrainian goods are brought into the territory of the free customs area subject to charging customs dues and the application of non-tariff regulation measures.\nThe goods that have been placed under the customs regime of a free customs area are under customs control during the entire term of staying under this regime.\nTransactions in the goods placed under the customs regime of free customs area that stay in the territories of free customs areas of a commercial type shall be limited only to simple warehouse operations required to ensure the safekeeping of these goods (the movement of the goods with a view to their rational placement, cleaning, airing, drying, protection against corrosion etc.). It shall also be allowed to break down batches into smaller ones, making up shipments, sorting, packaging, re-packaging, labeling, loading, unloading, reloading and other similar operations.\nThe performance of operations shall be allowed concerning the goods placed under the regime of free customs area that are located in the free customs area of the service type. These operations shall be related to repair, upgrade, and building of aircraft, sea and river vessels, other floating craft and their components as well as the operations that, similar to the commercial-type areas, were necessitated due to the operation of the FEZ.\nThe lists of the types of goods that may be placed under the customs regime of free trade area with a view to locating them in the territories of free customs areas of an industrial type and of production operations that may be performed concerning such goods shall be provided by individual laws of Ukraine on each such area.\nPlacing Ukrainian goods under the customs regime of free customs area for the purposes of taxation and custom control shall be considered as exports of such goods.\nState export control over goods shipments and provision of services is exercised on general grounds both when Ukrainian goods are placed under the customs regime of free customs area and when the goods are exported from the FEZ abroad.\n \nFEZ problems\nFree economic zones may encourage economic growth in the regions. However, their establishment has some negative consequences that are the emergence of smuggling, abuse in the field of privileged taxation, higher levels of corruption, infringement upon intellectual property rights and an increased volume of counterfeit production.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) noted that the share of counterfeit goods coming from the countries, in whose territories 20 largest FEZ are located, is twice bigger than the share of the countries that do not have FEZ.\nCauses of the increased production of counterfeit goods in the FEZ is lax supervision and a good infrastructure that such zones usually have.\nAnother fundamental problem of the free economic zone functioning in Ukraine is the reduction in investors’ innovative potential, because the investors view these zones only as a “tax heaven” for local business entities.\nThe establishment of the Crimea FEZ was an example of a lack of the sufficient effectiveness and negative phenomena. This FEZ was intended to promote operations of Ukrainian enterprises in the occupied peninsula. However, the results of this FEZ operations were criticized for it simplified the commission of illegal acts. In this sense, one of the main arguments is that the establishment of the FEZ caused an increase in the smuggling of goods. Weak customs control and the lack of strict supervision played their decisive role in aggravating the problem of counterfeit goods in the Crimea FEZ. This zone also features money laundering, tax evasion, market distortion, illegal trade in tobacco products and corruption.\nOne should take it into consideration that underpayment of customs fees to the budget of the country and smuggling of goods from the FEZ undermine competition for law-abiding market participants who are deprived of their chances to offer a full price for their goods under the conditions of paying full amounts of tax payable.\nTo prevent the occurrence of the described violations, strict controls, including those on the part of customs authorities, shall be established over the FEZ operations.\nFor a long time already, the International Chamber of Commerce has been analyzing the functioning of FEZ in different countries. As a result, the International Chamber of Commerce emphasizes the need to consider different aspects when establishing a FEZ in the state that would shape the interaction between enterprises and the State within the FEZ, namely:\n-         an enhanced cooperation between customs authorities and FEZ bodies;\n-         the granting to the customs authorities of a broad authority to monitor daily business operations occurring within the FEZ;\n-         the availability of effective training programs for customs officials on the issues of protection of intellectual property rights;\n-         a simplification of the procedure for notification of trademark owners of infringements.\nIt is also recommended for any new trade agreements signed by Ukraine to have clauses aiming to prevent an illegal use of the FEZ by law-breakers who infringe upon intellectual property rights.\n\n\n\n\n2.4. Controlled delivery\n\n\nSpecial features of international transfer of controlled goods\nSpecial features of export control over international transfers of military and dual-use goods, in contrast to other export-import operations with goods, lie in ensuring national security, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their of delivery, in limiting international transfers of conventional weapons and countering terrorism.

The SSECU may involve intelligence services of Ukraine in conducting such inspections.\n \nSection 3. Basic customs procedures\n3.1. Customs regimes\nAccording to Article 4 of the Customs Code of Ukraine, customs regime shall mean a set of interrelated legal rules that, according to the declared purpose of moving the goods across the customs border of Ukraine, determine the customs procedure applicable to these goods, their legal status and fiscal terms and determine their use after customs clearance. The chosen customs regime affects the possibility of transporting certain categories of goods, the customs clearance and customs control procedures, customs duties, as well as determines the scope of customs procedures to be transformed in the process of customs clearance of goods and vehicles. The customs regime determine:\n- the procedure for transporting goods across the customs border of Ukraine depending on its purpose (purpose of transportation);\n- conditions for placing goods and their possible use within (outside) the customs territory;\n- rights and obligations of the declarant;\n- the scope of powers of customs authorities.\n \nThe following custom regimes are being used in Ukraine:\n1) import (release for free turnover);\n2) re-import;\n3) export (final exportation);\n4) re-export;\n5) transit;\n6) temporary import;\n7) temporary export;\n8) customs warehouse;\n9) free customs zone;\n10) duty free trade;\n11) processing in the customs territory;\n12) processing outside the customs territory;\n13) destruction or abolition;\n14) refusal in favor of the State.\n \nThe customs applicant has the right to choose the custom regime, choose location to place the goods due to the order stipulated by Customs Code. Process of putting goods in the customs regime is carried out by declaration and execution of customs formalities. The custom regime in which the goods are placed may be changed to another, chosen by the customs applicant according to compliance of conditions on tariff and non-tariff regulation of foreign trade activities stipulated in accordance with the law for goods placed in another custom regime.\nDepending on their significance the customs regimes can be divided into two groups. The first one is characterized by the general, without any exceptions and restrictions, order of applying customs procedures. From the economic point of view, the customs regimes of this group are a kind of regulators for independent and complete commercial transactions that do not require further customs control over the use of goods after their customs clearance (import, re-port, export, re-export). The second group consists of the so-called economic regimes, which are characterized by more flexible use of customs and legal instruments to regulate foreign economic activity and require further customs control after customs clearance of goods. These customs regimes allow declarants to obtain some economic benefits and advantages in the form of full or partial exemption from customs duties and other taxes, as well as non-application of non-tariff measures, but the use of goods in these regimes is allowed only for a specific purpose: transit, temporary import/export, customs warehouse, special customs zone, duty-free shop, processing in the customs territory of Ukraine, processing outside the customs territory of Ukraine, destruction or abolition, refusal in favor of the state. According to the requirements for the application of these regimes, they require further control by customs authorities over their use and after completing their purpose require finalizing of customs control by issuing a customs declaration in accordance with the customs regime which ensures the removal of goods from the customs authority’s control.\nAccording to the customs status, goods are divided into Ukrainian and foreign. All goods in the custom territory of Ukraine (except for the territories of free custom zones) are considered to have the status of Ukrainian goods, if according to the Customs Code it is not stipulated that such goods are not Ukrainian.\nConditions for the accommodation of goods, transport vehicles of commercial purpose in the corresponding custom regime, restrictions on their use, application of measures of tariff and non-tariff regulation of foreign trade activities are determined by the Customs Code and other legislative acts of Ukraine on issues of the state custom service and foreign trade. Issues related to the implementation of the necessary customs formalities and the customs control of goods placed in the appropriate custom regime are regulated by the Customs Code.\n \n3.2. Customs formalities\nAll goods and vehicles of commercial purposes moving across the customs border of Ukraine are subject to customs control. Customs control is carried out exclusively by customs authorities in accordance with the Customs Code and other laws of Ukraine and stipulates implementation of the minimum customs formalities necessary to ensure compliance with the laws of Ukraine.\nThe Ministry of Finance of Ukraine has determined the Procedure for fulfilling customs formalities in accordance with the declared customs regime.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nProcedure No. 657 - Procedure for completion of customs formalities in accordance with the declared customs regime, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 657 dated 30.05.2012\n\n \nCustoms clearance shall commence after presentation by the customs applicant or the person authorized by him of the customs declaration or a document in lieu thereof under the law, and documents required for customs clearance, to the revenue and duties authorities, and in the case of an electronic declaration, upon receipt of the electronic customs declarations or an electronic document in lieu thereof under the law by the revenue and duties authority from the customs applicant or the person authorized by him.\nThe acceptance by the customs office of goods, means of transport for commercial use and documents for customs clearance shall be acknowledged by using the appropriate customs instrumentality (including information technology), and putting other marks on the customs declaration or the document in lieu thereof under the law, as well as the accompanying and transport documents if they are submitted in paper form (Article 248 of the Customs Code).\nThe procedure for performing customs formalities for the customs clearance of goods with the use of a customs declaration on the form of a single administrative document is approved by the Procedure No. 631\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nProcedure No. 631— Procedure for performing customs formalities for the customs clearance of goods with the use of a customs declaration on the form of a single administrative document, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 631 dated 30.05.2012\n\n \nIn case of importation into the customs territory of Ukraine of goods or commercial vehicles, customs control begins from the moment they cross the customs border of Ukraine.

The date of customs clearance, the number of the customs declaration, the name and quantity of goods specified in column 31 of the customs declaration shall be indicated on the reverse side of the original permit issued by the SSECU.\n \nThe Customs Code of Ukraine in its Article 252 provides the rule envisaging that military equipment complete with a military crew (combat and military transport aircraft, warships and support vessels of the Navy, etc.) that crosses the customs border of Ukraine shall be subject to customs clearance.\nCustoms clearance of the military equipment of foreign states shall be performed by the customs authority with the participation of the representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and, where the measures under which such goods are being moved belong within the scope of powers of another central executive authority, in the presence of the representatives of this central executive authority. The goods that are being moved over board of foreign warships and military aircraft to the customs territory of Ukraine or in the opposite direction shall be subject to the customs clearance in accordance with the procedure provided by the Customs Code of Ukraine.\n \nThe procedure for customs clearance of military equipment, including military vehicles crossing the customs border of Ukraine is approved by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 63 dated 18.01.2003. A special feature of customs clearance of military equipment is its implementation as a matter of priority and involvement SSECU to carry out the necessary formalities. When moving foreign military equipment across the customs border of Ukraine, the authorized person not later than 3 days before the customs clearance of this equipment submits a written application to the relevant customs authority stating the place, time, purpose of moving military equipment and incurred liabilities according to the law. The customs clearance of military equipment is carried out on condition the State Customs Service receives from the SSECU a permits or conclusion in electronic form with the use of qualified electronic signatures and in accordance with the CCU provisions. For the customs clearance of military equipment, a customs declaration filled in in accordance with the established procedure shall be submitted to the customs authority.\nCustoms clearance of military equipment crossing the customs border of Ukraine for the purpose of carrying out operational and tactical measures (military exercises, international peacekeeping and security operations, anti-terrorist operations, convoys of seagoing vessels, participation in emergency response, submission of military and humanitarian aid, etc.), is carried out without the submission of a permit or conclusion of the SSECU, if such transfer occurs within the framework of international agreement that stipulates a mechanism for the state control over movement of such goods. The list of military equipment crossing the customs border of Ukraine under international agreements that envisage a mechanism for the performance of state control over the movement of goods shall be coordinated with the State Service for Export Control of Ukraine and approved by the head (their deputy) of the central executive authority which administrative management domain includes such military equipment or which is the receiving party of such equipment.\nTaxes and fees during the customs clearance of military equipment are collected in the manner prescribed by law. These norms are also reflected in the Procedure for the implementation of customs formalities on sea and river transport, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 308 dated 10.03.2015.\n\n\nSection 4. Classifier of customs documents\n4.1. Types of customs declaration\nTo ensure compliance with the Customs Code (ССU), laws and other customs regulations of Ukraine, international treaties of Ukraine, concluded in the manner prescribed by law, the state provides a set of measures and procedures to be carried out by the officials of the Customs Service of Ukraine, as well as residents and non-residents who transport goods and valuables across the customs border of Ukraine for the purpose of import, export or transit. This set of procedures is defined by the term \"customs control\" and among others includes the procedure of customs clearance - the implementation of customs formalities required for the release of goods, commercial vehicles in various regimes. In their turn, customs formalities are a set of actions of relevant persons and customs authorities, as well as an automated system of customs clearance in order to comply with the requirements of Ukrainian customs legislation.\nThe obligatory element of customs clearance is customs declaration - submission of information to the customs authorities on all goods and vehicles moving across the customs border. According to the CCU, the declaration is made by indicating in the prescribed form (written, oral, or by action) the accurate information about goods, the purpose of their movement across the customs border of Ukraine, as well as information required for customs supervision and customs clearance. When using the written form of the declaration both electronic and paperback documents or their electronic (scanned) copies certified by the electronic digital signature of the customs applicant or his authorized person, may be used. Customs declaration and other documents, whose presentation to the revenue and duties authorities is provided for in the Customs Code, drawn up on paper and in the form of electronic documents shall be of equal legal force. However, filling in a customs declaration on paper is currently a backup method of declaration, thus requires prior agreement with the customs authority in which the customs clearance will take place. To declare goods, a customs declaration is used - application of the established form in which the person specifies the customs procedure that must be applied to the goods and the information about the goods, conditions and methods of their transportation across the custom border of Ukraine and calculation of the customs payments obligatory for the application of this procedure. The declaration is filled in by the cargo shipper, certified by the customs inspector and afterwards serves as the basis for crossing the border.\nWhen submitting the declaration, the customs value declaration is also used - a document of the prescribed form submitted by the customs applicant and containing information on the customs value of goods moving across the customs border of Ukraine or in respect to which the customs regime is being changed.\nThe CCU distinguishes the following types of declarations according to the period of their use and to the subject who fills in the declaration:\nStandard customs declaration\nThis is a declaration containing the particulars (data), sufficient to complete the customs clearance of goods under the customs procedure for which they were declared.\n \nCertain type customs declaration \n A certain type customs declaration is completed for the goods moving or that are to be moved in joint transit regime by a single vehicle from one customs office of departure or one authorized consignor to another customs office of destination or another authorized consignee in a separate cargo place or in other package, container or commercial vehicle.\nOne certain type customs declaration may also be filled in for goods in several separate cargo places or in other packages, containers, provided that these goods are loaded and moved or to be moved by a single vehicle.\n \n\n\t\n\nFor requirements for filling in a certain type customs declaration, see the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 681 dated August 5,2020.\n\n \nAdvance customs declaration\nThe advance customs declaration is submitted during customs registration of goods for which the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine stipulates a guarantee of customs payments. Advance declaration (or other document that may be used instead of a customs declaration in accordance with the CCU) may also be submitted for the purpose of risk analysis and speeding up customs formalities.\nExecution of such customs declaration involves the submission of an additional customs declaration for the goods and does not allow free use of the goods.\nIn cases when the documents in the field of customs clearance for the import of goods into the territory of Ukraine do not foresee advance declaration, a preliminary notice (PN) is being made- a document used to notify the customs authority of the intention to import/export goods into/out of the customs territory of Ukraine. For PN, customs and other obligatory payments are not charged. This document is not a cargo customs declaration and is used exclusively as a document for control of delivery of goods to the customs office of destination.\nTemporary customs declaration\nA temporary customs declaration is submitted in case the customs applicant or the person authorized by him does not have accurate particulars about the characteristics of the goods needed to fill in standard customs declaration or the customs authority has taken samples for those goods. The submission of a temporary declaration implies the obligation to file the main declaration within 45 days. The declaration is submitted on condition that it contains information sufficient for placing the goods for the declared customs procedure.\nPeriodic customs declaration\nPeriodic customs declaration is submitted for declaration of goods moving across the customs border of Ukraine by foreign going vessel, pipeline transport or power lines, supplies, periodicals and goods, movement of which across the customs border of Ukraine is planned at least twice during its validity .\nExecution of the periodic customs declaration foresees the subsequent submission to the customs and regulatory authorities of additional information on goods moved across the border under this declaration. Information is provided by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the goods were transported.\nWhen importing goods, means of transport for commercial use into Ukraine, including for transit, a periodic customs declaration shall be used instead of an advance customs declaration.\nSimplified customs declaration\nThe simplified customs declaration is used to declare and to release goods into the declared customs regime by an enterprise that has received the status of Authorized Economic Operator type C (AEO-C) and has permission to apply a \"simplified declaration procedure\" or by another enterprise on its behalf, which has received authorization type AEO-B and has a permit to carry out customs brokering activities.\nSupplementary declaration\nThe supplementary declaration shall be submitted by the customs applicant or a person authorized by them in case of submission of an advance, temporary, simplified or periodic customs declaration. The deadlines for submitting the supplementary declaration are determined by the CCU. The supplementary declaration shall contain the exact particulars of the goods declared under the advance, temporary, simplified or periodic customs declaration which would have been submitted if the goods had been declared under the standard customs declaration.\nGeneral declaration of arrival\nThe General Declaration of Arrival (GDA) is a notification of the customs authority about the goods intended for import into the customs territory of Ukraine, including for transit purposes, which contains information necessary for risk analysis to ensure security and reliability.\nGDA is submitted by the carrier of goods, or by another person on his behalf, to the revenue and duties authority, in operation area of ​​which the checkpoint across the state border of Ukraine is situated, where the goods first cross the customs border of Ukraine. GDA is submitted before such goods arrive in the customs territory of Ukraine, including in the customs transit regime.\nThe general declaration of arrival is submitted to the revenue and duties authority in the form of an electronic message certified by an electronic digital signature, or via the interface for submitting such declaration posted on the official website of the central executive body implementing state customs policy.\n\n\t\n\nInformation on the submission of GDA, including the list of exceptions when the GDA is not submitted, is given in paragraph 2 of Article 1941 of the CCU.\n\nTheamount of data entered into the GDA is regulated by the Order of the Ministryof Finance of Ukraine No.502 dated 13.08.2020 \"On approval of the Listof data to be entered into the general declaration of arrival\"\n\n \n\n\t\n\nRequirements for filing in the above-mentioned declarations are listed in Chapter 40 of the CCU.\n\n \n The type of a written declaration form is also the criterion for classifying the types of customs declaration. Goods are declared by submitting the following declarations to the customs authority:\nCustoms declaration on the form of a single administrative document (SAD)\nSAD forms are used to make a standard, advance, temporary, periodic and supplementary customs declarations.\nInter alia, SADs are used to declare goods that are subject to the state export control and the transportation of which across the customs border of Ukraine in accordance with the law requires the issuance of a permit or conclusion.\nIt is used both when moving goods by enterprises and citizens (except in cases when the CCU and the Regulation on declarations provide for the use of other types of declarations).\n \n\n\t\n\n  Forms of SAD are regulated by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 450 dated 21.05.2012 and are given in its appendix.\n\n \nCustoms declaration M-16\nDeclaration M-16 is used to declare goods that according to the CCU are not subject to declaration under the SAD and are sent across the customs border of Ukraine in international express shipments in case:\n- the citizen receives at his address the goods, the total invoice value of which exceeds the amount that is not subject to customs duties, but does not exceed the amount equivalent to 10,000 euros;\n- the citizen sends the goods that are subject to export duty, and / or if in accordance with the law the state authorities issue documents necessary for customs control and customs clearance of such goods.\n\n\t\n\n  Forms of M-16 declaration are regulated by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 450 dated 21.05.2012and are given in its appendix.\n\n \nWritten application\nThe goods that are moved by customs applicants (except citizens) across the customs border of Ukraine (except for international postal and express shipments) for which the customs declaration is not filled in on the SAD form and which cannot be declared according to another document, are declared with a written application.\nSuch an application may be submitted to the customs authority on paper or as an electronic document.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nThe application form is defined in Annex 1 to the Regulation on customs declarations, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 450 dated21.05.2012.\n\n \nUnified international documents\nUnified customs declarations CN 22 and CN 23, the forms of which are established by the acts of the Universal Postal Union, are used to declare goods sent across the customs border of Ukraine in international mail, and which are not declared by submitting the SAD when:\n- sending parcels, international grouped postal items marked \"Consignment\" and \"EMS\" items, and in case of sending items with declared value (CN 23);\n- sending small packages, \"M\" bags and \"EMS\" items with the attachment of written correspondence, and in case of sending parcels (CN 22).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n  Forms of CN 22 and CN 23 can be found here:https://www.upu.int/en/Postal-Solutions/Programmes-Services/Physical-Services/Letter-Post-Forms \n\n \nCustoms declaration for written declaration of goods\nSuch a declaration is issued for goods moved across the customs border of Ukraine by citizens for personal, family and other needs not related to business activities.\nThe form of the customs declaration for written declaration of goods is approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.614 dated 28.05.2012\n\n\t\n\nThe procedure for filling out the declaration is determined by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.614 dated 28.05.2012\n\n\n\nOther documents that according to the law can be used instead of customs declaration\nAccording to the law, in some cases instead of the customs declaration on the SAD form other documents for declaration of the goods can be used. Such cases and documents are given below in subsection 4.3.\n4.2. Transport documents\nThe Customs Code of Ukraine does not specifically define the concept of \"transport documents\", but based on the general practice of customs procedures, it can be determined that transport documents include documents accompanying the cargo during transportation, and that are used to identify participants of the foreign economic operation, to identify the goods value, quality, quantity, as well as documents that in the cases provided by the CCU can replace the customs declaration.\nThe purpose of customs control procedures is to check what goods cross the border, to prevent smuggling and uncontrolled crossing of border by prohibited or controlled substances / goods, as well as to prevent violation of international agreements to which Ukraine is a party. For this purpose, at various stages of transportation and crossing the customs border, documents for the transported goods (both for import/export and in transit) are being checked, as well as passengers and their belongings and luggage. In this regard, the customs authorities are provided with shipping documents, as well as various derivative declarations formed on the basis of data available to carriers. For the purposes of this section and in the framework of Ukrainian customs formalities, the term \"transport documents\" comprises a set of documents related to the procedure of crossing the border on different transportation modes.\nThe basic transport documents for all transportation modes, with some differences related to their specifics, are covered below.\n \nCommercial documents\nFor all modes of transport, these are the documents for the transported goods, which contain information including the name and address of the carrier, the country of departure and destination, the name and address of the sender (or seller) and consignee, conditions of their transfer, quantity and cost. Usually such documents are invoice or pro-forma Invoice. From the point of view of customs clearance, the main function of the invoice is the accompanying function, but it has also the function of a settlement document. Invoice is used for transactions with the transfer of property rights on a commercial basis, while pro-forma invoice is used for free transmissions and temporary import / export.\nAnother commercial document is the delivery specification, which determines the name, total volume, price and value of goods.\nAt customs clearance of goods transported by pipeline transport or power supply lines the act of acceptance-transfer of the goods or the certificate confirming the quantity of goods is also provided.\n \nVehicle registration documents\nThese are the documents that contain information about the state registration of the vehicle (nationality), operator, name, board number and other identification information.\nFor road transport, such document is a technical passport for the car and trailer (if available) and / or documents on the right of joint ownership of the vehicle. The name of the document may differ depending on the country of registration.\n For air transport, this is information on the marks of nationality and registration or military mark of the vessel, flight number, route number, departure point and point of arrival of the aircraft; information on the name of the enterprise (organization, institution) operating the vessel and the number of crew members.\nFor maritime transport, it is a general declaration containing, in particular, the name and description of the vessel, information on its registration and nationality, the surname of the captain, the surname and address of the ship's agent. The form of the general declaration is defined by the International standards.\n\n\t\n\nThe form of the General Declaration is approved by the International Maritime Organization. The IMO General Declaration can be found at www.imo.org \n\n \nCommodity transport document\nThis document confirms the acceptance of goods by the carrier, identifies the consignor and the consignee, the information about the transport agent, the date, the volume of the goods, packaging and the generally accepted identification of hazardous properties.\nFor road transport, the International Consignment Note (CMR) is used - an international consignment note which is used in international trade, or the TIR carnet. Completion of the CMR is regulated by the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (Convention relative to the contract of carriage by international transport). Its form is not uniform and may differ in different countries.\n \n\n \n\n\t\n\nThe TIR carnet is described in section 4.3.\n\n \nAir way-bill (AWB), which is a unified international document, is used in air transportation.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe AWB Form is provided by IATA Cargo Services Resolution. One may familiarize themselves with it on the website www.iata.org \n\n \nIn the course of transportation by sea, a bill of lading is used that is a shipment document that, by partly reproducing the terms of the contract for carriage of goods by sea, certifies the fact of accepting the cargo for the carriage by sea transport and the performance of the parties’ obligations related to it. If an entire vessel or its portion is chartered for the cargo, the contract of sea transportation shall be formalized by a charter party or a charter.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe form of the bill of lading is not unified and is different at various sea shipping companies. The drawing up of the bill of lading is regulated by the following: \n\n-The Hague Rules that were officially approved in 1921 (InternationalConvention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills ofLading);\n\n-The Hague–Visby Rules in accordance with the Brussels Protocol of 1968 torevise the Hague Rules of 1921;\n\n-the Hamburg Rules in accordance with the current United Nations Convention onthe Carriage of Goods by Sea/River, 1978\n\n \nRailroad transport uses SMGS way-bills, СІМ and a CIM/SMGS unified way-bills.\n\n\t\n\nThe form and rules for completing the way-bill are provided by Annex 6 to the Agreement on International Goods Transport by Rail of 01.11.1951. \n\n \nWhen postal items are transported, one may find the document to accompany them provided by the acts of the Universal Postal Union.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe forms of the documents of the Universal Postal Union can be found at: https://www.upu.int/en/Postal-Solutions/Programmes-Services/Physical-Services/Letter-Post-Forms \n\n \nDocuments of title to goods\nFor the purposes of this Section, the documents of title to goods shall be the documents that provide a more detailed information concerning the quantity and origin of the cargo, the type of its packaging, the requirements to its reloading, opening, and storage. These are the documents that are used for the importation to the buyer’s country and crossing transit countries. Customarily, these include packing slips and packing sheets, certificates of quality and origin, the weight evidence, shipping specifications, transfer and cargo inspection instructions etc.\n \nDerivative declarations\nThese are declarations and other documents that have a declarative nature that are drawn up by the carriers or authorized persons with regard to cargoes and passengers that are on board the vehicle based on the above-listed source documents.\nSuch derivative documents include the following:\n \n1) for all types of transport, except pipeline:\n- general declaration of arrival (GDA);\n \n\n\t\n\nMore detailed information on the general declaration of arrival is given in section 4.1\n\n \n2) for air transport:\n- Cargo Manifest;\n \n\n\t\n\nThe form and requirements for filling in the Cargo Manifest are given in the Order of the State Service of Ukraine for Aviation Safety Supervision No. 822dated 02.11.2005. \n\n \n- a document containing information on supplies (on-board supplies) and on the amount of supplies (on-board supplies) loaded on board and unloaded from the vessel;\n- information on the number of crew members;\n- the number of passengers on the ship, their names and initials, landing and disembarkation points; information on passengers' luggage (passenger boarding list);\n- information about the presence (absence) on board of goods import of which into Ukraine is prohibited or restricted, including currency values available to the crew, medicines, which include narcotic, potent, psychotropic and poisonous substances;\n3) for railway transport:\n- transfer freight bill for the railway rolling stock;\n- document certifying the availability of supplies (if there are any);\n4) for maritime transport:\n- cargo declaration which contains in particular information on the ports of departure, ports of call, loading and unloading of goods, the first port of shipment, port of unloading of goods that remain on board, list of bills of lading, number of cargo places, description and type of goods packaging to be unloaded at this port;\n- declaration of supplies (ship's stores) available on the ship and their quantity;\n- declaration of personal belongings of the ship's crew;\n- ship's role with information on the number and composition of crew members at the arrival and departure of the ship, in particular, surnames, names, citizenship, title or position, date and place of birth, type and number of identification document;\n- list of passengers with information about passengers present on vessel at arrival and departure, in particular, the number of passengers on board, surnames, names, citizenship, date and place of birth, ports of embarkation and disembarkation;\n- information about the presence (absence) on board of goods import of which into Ukraine is prohibited or restricted, including currency values available to the crew, medicines, which include narcotic, potent, psychotropic and poisonous substances;\n- information about the presence (absence) on board of dangerous goods, weapons and ammunition.\n \nOther documents\n1) Material Safety Datasheet (MSDS) - a document that reflects in detail the dangerous properties of cargo (if any) that affects the conditions and type of transportation within Ukraine, the carrier's admission to transportation, and also in some cases allows to define the goods that are subject to the state export control or licensing.\n2) Insurance policy – in case the insurance is mandatory under the terms of the supply contract or voluntarily carried out by the importer. It is used to determine the customs value to carry out the import procedures.\n3) Documents (permits, certificates) confirming the goods properties in case of supply with pipeline transport or power lines.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe list of documents required for customs control and customs clearance of goods and vehicles moving across the customs border of Ukraine is determined by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 80 dated February 1,2006 (https://www.kmu.gov.ua/npas/28438605)\n\n \n4.3. Other documents confirming the right of ownership / possession or use / release of goods.\nOne of the main documents used to determine the right of ownership / possession or use of goods is a foreign trade agreement, the form of which is approved by the Regulation on the form of foreign trade agreements (contracts). The agreement (contract) is concluded according to the Law of Ukraine \"About foreign economic activity\" and other laws of Ukraine taking into account international agreements of Ukraine. However, for the declaration purpose the CCU provides for the submission of a copy of a foreign trade contract or a document that replaces it.\nTo ensure the requirement of the CCU to provide information on the foreign trade transaction, the following data shall be indicated in such document: full name of the parties - participants in the foreign trade transaction; goods / services that one of the contractors is obliged to deliver (perform) with the exact name, trademark, brand or the end result of the performed work; quantity and quality of goods; type of transport and basic terms of delivery; unit price of goods and total cost of goods; terms of payments; packaging and labeling of goods and other details. Thus, this document becomes a full-fledged substitute for the contract. Such document may be in a form of an offer-acceptance, invoice-order, correspondence of the parties containing all the necessary information about the transaction, etc.\nIn some cases, the right of disposal may be confirmed by documents confirming the alienation, transfer, gift, ownership of the object crossing the border, etc.\nIn addition to the document replacing the contract, the Customs Code of Ukraine provides also for the replacement of standard declarations i.e. documents confirming the right of ownership / possession or use / release of goods.\nSuch replacement is possible in the following cases:\n- in case of transportation of goods in the customs transit regime, if the CCU or other documents do not explicitly state the need to use a standard document;\n- when the customs regime of re-import and customs warehouse is applied;\n- when Ukraine's accession to International Treaties that regulate such documents and their forms is legally formalized.\nA change in the customs documents under the “transit” customs regime\nThe Customs Code of Ukraine provides that when the goods are formally placed under the customs regime of transit the following shall apply:\n- depending on the mode of transport, in the event of a transit within the boundaries of one checkpoint or to declare the goods that are not excisable goods, air way-bill or a bill of lading may be used instead of a customs declaration:\n- to declare the goods that are not excisable goods, a SMGS way-bill or a СIМ way-bill, a CIM/SMGS way-bill, or a Carnet TIR may be used instead of the customs declaration;\n- irrespective of the mode of transport, to declare goods and commercial-purpose vehicles under the customs regime of transit, an ATA Carnet or a CPD Carnet may be used;\n- in the cases envisioned by international agreements of Ukraine entered into in accordance with law, the documents provided by such agreements shall be used to declare the transit of goods and commercial vehicles under the customs regime of transit;\n- to declare commercial vehicles that are being moved between the European Union, member countries of the European Free Trade Association and individual countries that are members of the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure and Ukraine, customs declarations of individual types may be used that are in line with the types of the customs declarations implemented by the said Convention.\n \nReplacement of customs documents under the customs regimes of “re-import” and “customs warehouse”\nThe Customs Code of Ukraine, in particular, has the following provisions concerning the application of the customs regime of re-import and the conditions for the placement of goods under the customs regime of customs warehouse:\n- to declare packaging, containers, pallets and commercial vehicles under the customs regime of re-import, the documents are used instead of the customs declaration that confirm the previous importation of the said goods beyond the customs territory of Ukraine (Article 79 of the Customs Code of Ukraine);\n- to place goods that had been placed under other than customs warehouse customs regimes (transit, temporary import, processing in the customs territory, export, processing beyond the customs territory) at the customs warehouse for their storage, reloading or additional loading on the vehicle, shall be performed based on the customs declaration that had been formalized earlier in accordance with such customs regimes or a document that replaced it – an SMGS way-bill, a СIМ way-bill, a CIM/SMGS way-bill, a Carnet TIR etc. In this case, the placement of such goods under the customs regime of customs warehouse does not occur (Article 122 of the Customs Code of Ukraine).\n \nReplacement of documents within the framework of international conventions\nUkraine is a party to 2 international conventions:\n- Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention);\n- Istanbul Convention on Temporary Admission (Istanbul Convention)\n \nTIR Convention\nThe TIR Convention was signed by the member states in order to create an international system of cargo transportation, which simplifies the procedures for their registration when crossing borders. In addition, the use of the TIR Carnet has favored to partially resolve the issue of guaranteeing the customs duties payment on goods transported by road and railway by providing international guarantee.\nThe Convention stipulates that goods transported in accordance with the TIR procedures shall be exempt from payment or deposit of import or export duties, taxes and charges at the transit customs. Fees for customs clearance of TIR Carnets are not charged at these customs offices. In addition, goods transported in accordance with the TIR procedures, in sealed vehicles or containers, are generally exempt from customs inspection at transit customs.\nCustoms inspection at these customs offices may be carried out in exceptional cases, if there are sufficient grounds to consider that the sealed compartments of vehicles or containers contain items not specified in the TIR Carnet manifest.\nTransportation under the TIR procedure is carried out on the basis of the TIR Carnet – a customs consignment note which gives the right to transport goods across the borders. The document covers road and railway transportation of goods (carried out in vans, trailers, semi-trailers and containers) between states that recognize the Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under Cover of TIR Carnets.\nThe TIR Carnet replaces the road international consignment note and the railway CIM / SMGT consignment notes.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe form of the TIR Carnet is internationally recognized. In Ukraine, the Association of International Road Carriers of Ukraine (ASMAP) is authorized to issue TIR Carnets.\n\n \nIstanbul Convention\nFor the international settlement of temporary import of goods to other countries on preferential terms, in 1961 the Customs Convention on the A.T.A. for the temporary import of goods (A.T.A. Convention) was adopted.\nThis international agreement introduced the A.T.A. - the only international customs document accepted by the customs authorities of the Convention member-states as a customs declaration and at the same time as an international guarantee of import duties and taxes coverage in accordance with the national legislation of the country of import / transit in case of violation of temporary admission.\nOn the basis of the A.T.A. Convention in 1990, the Convention on Temporary Admission was signed, bringing together all existing separate international agreements on these issues.\nUkraine acceded to the Istanbul Convention on Temporary Admission in 2004, and with the accession of Ukraine’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry into the international network of guaranteeing associations, in 2008 Ukraine became a full member of the A.T.A. international system and introduced the circulation of A.T.A. carnets on its customs territory.\nIn order to be able to use the simplifications provided by the use of the A.T.A. carnet:\n- the number or quantity of each article must be reasonable having regard to the purpose of importation;\n- the customs authorities of the territory of temporary admission must be satisfied that the conditions of the Convention shall be fulfilled.\nThe Istanbul Convention provides for a \"temporary importation document\", which is an international customs document accepted as a customs declaration and allows to identify the goods (including vehicles). In the framework of Convention, the temporary admission documents may be:\n- A.T.A. carnet (admission temporaire-temporary admission) used for the temporary admission of all goods described in the Convention, excluding means of transport;\n\n\t\n\nThe form the A.T.A. carnet is determined by the Istanbul Convention and is internationally recognized. In Ukraine, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine and its regional offices are authorized to issue the A.T.A. carnets.\n\n \n- CPD (Carnet de Passages en Douane) used for the temporary admission of means of transport.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nAt present, there are neither legal acts that would determine the procedure or the authorized organizations to issue CPD carnets in Ukraine, nor the procedure for customs clearance of vehicles moving across the customs border of Ukraine using such an international customs document.\n\n \nThe scope of the A.T.A. carnets covers:\n- goods for display or use at exhibitions, fairs, meetings, or similar events;\n- advertising materials, samples, musical equipment, professional equipment and spare parts for its repair, containers and parts for their repair, pallets, packaging, goods imported in connection with production operations or for educational, scientific or cultural activities and spare parts for them, welfare material for seafarers.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nIf the goods meet the criteria of the Istanbul Convention for temporary import/export, but require a permit or conclusion of the State Export Control Service of Ukraine to cross the border, in accordance with the Regulation on customs declarations, the customs clearance is carried with a customs declaration, thus the A.T.A. carnet is not applicable.\n\n \n\n\t\n\nRegulation on customs declarations approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 450 dated May 21, 2012 \n\n \n\n\n Section 5. Transportation of strategic goods, as well as transportation of dangerous goods\n \nGiven that there is no unambiguous definition of the term \"strategic goods\" in Ukraine, the criteria for classifying goods as strategic for the purpose of this Handbook will be:\n- priority of export development in the near future;\n- the impact of imports of such goods on the development of priority industries;\n- pertinent to dual-use goods;\n- the presence of dangerous properties in the product.\nAccording to the brochure on the Export Strategy of Ukraine, published by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine, the promising sectors for the development of Ukrainian exports are:\n- information and communication technologies;\n- creative industries;\n- tourism;\n- aircrafts maintenance and repair;\n- production of parts for the aerospace and aviation industries;\n- mechanical engineering;\n- food and processing industry.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe brochure can be found at: https://bit.ly/2Cfu4CT\n\n \nGiven these criteria and priority areas, the following goods will be considered as strategic goods for the purposes of this Handbook:\n- goods related to the development of missiles and aircrafts,\n- goods used for the development of military equipment (but not included into the lists of military goods),\n- goods associated with the production of nuclear energy.\nThough other dual-use goods have an impact on the development of technologies, they do not require any additional formalities during transportation. Therefore, description of the transportation requirements to the above listed goods will demonstrate basic requirements for the movement of strategic dual-use goods (including those with hazardous properties) across the customs border of Ukraine.\n\n\n5.1. Permits and authorizations provided by international and bilateral agreements\nThe permits are applied when strategic goods that are being discussed in this Handbook Section, are moved across the border. The permits can be of 2 types:\n1) permits in the field of non-proliferation of missiles and other weapons and nuclear materials;\n2) permits in the field of transportation.\nThe first type includes the permits of the SSECU (State Service for Export Control of Ukraine) for the transfer of dual-use and military goods and the permits of the SNRIU (State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine) for the international transportation of radioactive materials. These permits are granted in accordance with the basic principles and rules of international non-proliferation regimes (e.g., MTCR, WA, NSG) and UN Security Council Resolutions on embargoes on certain goods, as well as other international agreements on the distribution and movement of radioactive materials and nuclear technologies.\nThese documents are examined by the customs when goods cross the border. When goods subject to export control are being exported, it may be necessary to obtain the relevant permit in the importing country. However, this issue is not subject to customs control in the country of departure and is the responsibility of the consignee.\nThe second type includes permits (ordinary and special) for the international road transportion of conventional, bulky, extra heavy and dangerous cargos. Permits inspected by customs may also include certificates of admission of vehicles and drivers to international transportation and certification of vehicles for the transportation of dangerous goods.\nThe need to obtain permits for transportation is determined by international and bilateral agreements signed by the Government of Ukraine. Among the international agreements, the most significant in this aspect are:\n- The Convention on Road Traffic;\n- European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR);\n- Agreement concerning the Adoption of Harmonized Technical United Nations Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be Fitted and/or be Used on Wheeled Vehicles and the Conditions for Reciprocal Recognition of Approvals Granted on the Basis of these United Nations Regulations of 1958, amended in 1995 (\"Geneva Agreement\");\n- Association Agreement with the European Union;\n- European Agreement concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport (AETR);\n- Agreement on Cooperation of the CIS Member States in the Field of International Road Freight Transport.\nAdditionally, Ukraine has concluded about 50 bilateral agreements on the international transportation of goods by road. These agreements, among other things, stipulate the receipt of:\n- ordinary authorizations for international bilateral transportations, transit, cabotage, as well as transportation carried out by the vehicle of one contracting country between locations in the other contracting country and a third country;\n- special permits for international transportation of oversized, heavy and dangerous goods (henceforth referred as– “DG”).\n \n\n\t\n\nThe list of international agreements of Ukraine in the field of road transportation with the titles, dates of conclusion and entry into force can be found on the website of the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine at: https://mtu.gov.ua/files/Угоди%20в%20галузі%20автомобільного%20транспорту.doc \n\n \n \nThe structure and conditions of the Agreements are standardized and in terms of permits for transportation the typical conditions are as follows:\n- a separate permit must be issued for each freight vehicle, which gives the right to carry out transportation to the destination point and back, unless otherwise specified in the permit itself;\n- a special permit is issued for the transportation of oversized and/ or heavy loads;\n- transportation of DG is determined by the terms of ADR;\n- carriers of one Party are not allowed to transport passengers and cargo between two points located in the territory of the other Party, unless authorized by the competent authorities of the other Party;\n- carriers of one Party are not allowed to carry out transportation from the territory of the other Party to third countries and vice versa, unless the permit of the competent authorities of the other Party is given;\n- in all cases not regulated by the relevant agreement, carriers and drivers of vehicles of one Contracting Party while being in the state territory of the other Contracting Party shall comply with its current legislation and applicable international agreements;\n- moving across the border by car does not require permits.\nAll agreements include goods transportation of which does not require a transportation permit (hereinafter - \"Permit\"). A typical list of such goods is as follows:\n- exhibits, equipment and materials intended for fairs and exhibitions;\n- vehicles, animals, as well as a variety of equipment and property intended for sporting events;\n- theatrical scenery and props, musical instruments, equipment and accessories for filming, radio and television programs;\n- bodies or ashes of the dead;\n- mail;\n- damaged vehicles;\n- movable property during resettlement;\n- bees and fish fry;\n- cargoes transported by vehicles, the maximum permissible gross weight of which, including trailers, does not exceed 6 tons or the maximum payload of which, including the payload of trailers, does not exceed 3.5 tons (hereinafter - \"trucks up to 6 tons\");\n- medical equipment and materials for emergency care in case of natural disasters;\n- technical assistance vehicles.\n \nDeviations from the standard conditions in agreements with individual countries are listed in the table 5.1.1., namely:\n- additional to standard goods, transportation of which does not require a permit;\n- goods that are not included into the list goods transportation of which does not require a permit;\n- additional conditions for issuing permits;\n- prohibitions on cabotage or transportation to/from third countries;\n- the need to obtain a special permit for the transportation of DG;\n- other conditions and additional information.\n \nTable 5.1.1.

General principles of international road transport of goods\n \nGiven the need to develop economic relations and the impact of cargo transportation on this process in the international practice, the following principles of international transportation have been established:\n- ensuring a non-discriminatory approach to carriers, which, first of all, is to impose requirements on foreign carriers no more stringent than on their own;\n- development of generally accepted norms and rules of international transportation;\n- advanced training of crews and technical condition of vehicles;\n- constant work on improving the safety of transportation of conventional, oversized, heavy and dangerous goods;\n- ensuring control of carriers, drivers, vehicles and delivery;\n- equality of approaches and parity of requirements or restrictions between the parties to bilateral and international agreements;\n- providing the fastest possible access to information on changes in the legislation and rules of transportation of each country.\nIt is especially important to note the increase in requirements for the environmental friendliness of transportation, which results in increased requirements for the vehicles that carry them out.\n \n5.3. Certain dual-use items as dangerous goods\n \nWhen transporting goods, it must be assessed whether they are dangerous goods. According to the ADR, and also to the Law of Ukraine \"On transportation of dangerous cargos\", dangerous goods can be places into one or several of the following classes of danger:\n\nClassNo.\n\n\t\n\nDivisionNo.\n\n\t\n\nNameof class or division\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nExplosives \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.1\n\n\t\n\nExplosives with a mass explosion hazard\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.2\n\n\t\n\nExplosives with a projection hazard but that do not constitute amass explosion hazard\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.3\n\n\t\n\nExplosives with predominately a fire hazard and a minor blast hazardor a minor  projection hazard or both,but without a mass explosion hazard\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.4\n\n\t\n\nExplosives with no significant blast hazard\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.5\n\n\t\n\nVery insensitive explosives; blasting agents\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n1.6\n\n\t\n\nExtremely insensitive detonating substances \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nGases\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2.1\n\n\t\n\nFlammable gas\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2.2\n\n\t\n\nNon-flammable compressed gas \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2.3\n\n\t\n\nPoisonous gas\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nFlammable and combustible liquid \n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nFlammable solid; Spontaneously combustible material; \n\nDangerous when wet material\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n4.1\n\n\t\n\nFlammable solid\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n4.2\n\n\t\n\nSpontaneously combustible material\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n4.3\n\n\t\n\nDangerous when wet material \n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nOxidizer and Organic peroxide\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n5.1\n\n\t\n\nOxidizer\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n5.2\n\n\t\n\nOrganic peroxide\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nPoisonous materials and Infectious substance\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nPoisonous materials\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n6.2\n\n\t\n\nInfectious substance\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nRadioactive material\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nCorrosive material\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nMiscellaneous hazardous material \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nGenerally, class 9 includes cargos that comprise lithium-ion or lithium-pol batteries.  \n\n\n\n\n\nDuring customs clearance of dual-use goods that are listed in the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine №86 of January 28, 2004 and that have dangerous properties, it is necessary to comply with the requirements of regulatory documents for the carriage of goods with dangerous properties.\n\n\nA list of the principal items of strategic goods that are also included in the Annex to the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 86 and the relevant types of hazards that are often characteristic of these goods are set forth in Table 5.3.1.\n\n\n\nName and description of the goods\n\n\t\n\nPossiblehazard classes[1]\n\n\n\n\nSpecial fissionable materials (nuclear fuel elements belong to this category)\n\n\t\n\nClass 7\n\n\n\n\nEquipmentand devices specifically intended for triggering charges and devicescontaining energy-related material using the electric means, namely:\n\n…\n\nelectricdetonators or explosive devices, namely:\n\ndetonators with a resistance bridge (spark detonators);\n\ndetonators with an explosive wire jumper (current detonators);\n\ndetonatorswith a firing-pin mechanism (detonators with a striking mechanism);\n\ndetonatorswith explosive foil\n\nSometimes, the words “trigger” or “igniter”are used instead of the word “detonator.”\n\n \n\n\t\n\nClasses 1.2 - 1.4\n\n\n\n[24] Typical and characteristic hazard classes are set forth in the Table.

Regulations for the carriage of dangerous goods through the customs territory\n \nTransportation of dangerous goods through the customs territory of Ukraine is regulated by the Law of Ukraine \"On Transportation of Dangerous Goods\", Codes of Transport of Dangerous Goods by Land, Sea and Air Transport (respectively, ADR/RID, MTRDG (maritime transportation rules of dangerous goods), IATA DGR), international and bilateral agreements. Transportation of radioactive materials is additionally regulated by the Law of Ukraine \"On the Use of Nuclear Energy and Radiation Safety\".\nTransportation of goods may be carried out in exempted quantities (the presence of exempted quantities in each substance and its value is determined by each code separately), which does not require licenses to transport DG, driver's admission to such transportation or compliance with specific conditions and requirements of legislation on transportation. If the volume of substances or materials transported exceeds the established exempted quantities, it is required to use vehicles with a certificate of admission to the transportation of dangerous goods, and crews trained in the field of transportation of dangerous goods. In accordance with bilateral conditions with some countries for the carriage of any DG, it is necessary to obtain a special permit for transportation. It is mandatory to obtain a transport permit for the transportation of radioactive materials. For transportation of cargoes of a 1.1. class of danger, it is mandatory to involve cargo escorting.\nWhen transporting dangerous goods, it is obligatory to mark them in accordance with the Code of transportation of DG by appropriate transport. It is also obligatory to put danger signs on motor vehicles, corresponding to the transported cargo, in accordance with ADR.\nIn accordance with the Law of Ukraine \"On Transportation of Dangerous Goods\" the responsibilities of the carrier are:\n- in case of road transport, to develop and agree with the National Police authorities the routes and modes of transport of dangerous goods; to ensure timely inspection of vehicles by the territorial bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, and to obtain the relevant certificate of admission to the transportation of dangerous goods; during transportation do not deviate from the agreed route, adhere to safe traffic conditions and constantly monitor the condition of the vehicle and cargo;\n- to provide special training, advanced training of persons engaged in the transportation of dangerous goods, and their medical examination; in case of road transportation, to ensure that drivers receive certificates of admission to the transportation of dangerous goods of the established standard after training and passing the relevant examinations in the territorial bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine;\n- to underwrite liability of subjects of transportation of dangerous cargoes in the established order.\nTransit of dangerous goods through the territory of Ukraine is carried out exclusively in direct connection with one mode of transport without reloading on another.\n\n\n Section 6. Risk management system in relation to goods subject to customs clearance\n6.1. Brief overview of risk management system\nUkraine's European integration processes necessitate optimization and simplification of customs control based on the application of a risk management system.\nThe purpose of the risk management system is to accelerate the customs clearance of goods ensuring the selectivity of customs control by focusing the attention of customs authorities on high-risk foreign economic transactions that allows simplifying customs formalities for bona-fide subjects of foreign economic activity.\nCustoms authorities use the risk management system to identify goods, vehicles, documents and persons subject to customs control.\nAutomated Risk Analysis and Management System (ARAMS) is a set of software and information systems that ensure the functioning of the Risk Management System (RMS) during customs control and clearance of goods and vehicles. With the general tendency to reduce the physical inspection, the automated risk management system becomes one of the main factors in the prompt conduct of customs formalities.\nARAMS is based on the experience of preventing, forecasting and detecting violations of customs legislation. The main areas of control of ARAMS are the declaration accuracy, customs value correctness, country of origin and classification of goods in accordance with UCGFEA (Ukrainian Classifier of Goods of Foreign Economic Activities), compliance with non-tariff regulations, etc.\nAnother feature of ARAMS is that it allows taking into account the previous behavior of the subject of foreign economic activity during the risk assessment. The database accumulates so-called positive and negative records, the use of which allows to automatically adjust the risk assessment over time.\nHence, ARAMS contains a balanced approach to risk assessment of the customs declaration using the risk profiles introduced into the system. The main task of ARAMS is to assess the risk of the customs declaration accepted for customs clearance on the basis of all existing profiles and to issue a notification indicating the necessary measures.\nARAMS operates at the central and regional levels. ARAMS at the central level (central profiling) ensures the same scope and forms of customs control of goods and commercial vehicles regardless of the customs authority that the customs declaration is submitted to. In addition, the customs offices use individually the regional risk profiles that are filled with consideration for the risk areas specific to these regions. However, if an official person decides that a certain customs formality is required for goods or vehicles, information about such decision is immediately entered by this official person into the automated risk management system.\nThus, the list of customs formalities is formed based on the results of automated control using a risk management system, and can be supplemented/adjusted by the customs based on the results of non-automated control using a risk management system.\nIn accordance with the Customs Code of Ukraine, Section XI, Chapter 52, second part of Article 363, the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine approved the Procedure for the risk analysis and assessment, development and implementation of risk management measures to determine the forms and scope of customs control (hereinafter - Procedure № 684)\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nProcedure № 684 — Procedure for the risk analysis and assessment, development and implementation of risk management measures to determine the forms and scope of customs control, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine № 684 dated 31.07.2015 \n\n \n\n\n6.2. Identification and assessment of risks\nCreation of the risk management system database at the customs authorities involves maintenance of the risk database by the State Customs Service.\nThe risk database is formed using the available information on identified and potential risks of non-compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation on customs matters, including those received from the customs officials.\nIn order to keep the risk database up to date, customs officials enter information on potential risks of non-compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation on customs matters.\nThe risk database includes, in particular, information on:\n- possible cases of non-compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation on customs matters received from another public authority, the competent authority of another country or from any other source of information;\n- circumstances that may affect the results of customs control (for example, the detection of empty caches in the vehicle).\nThe risk database is a source of information that can be used by customs authorities (their structural units) in the risk management process.\nImplementation of analysis, detection and assessment of risks, including with the use of information technology, to determine the forms and scope of customs control by customs authorities (their structural units) include:\n1) identification of conditions and factors influencing the occurrence of risks;\n2) identification of risk areas;\n3) identification of risk indicators;\n4) risk probability estimation and assessment of possible damage in case of their occurrence.\nAnalysis, identification and assessment of risks, development and implementation of practical measures for risk management, analysis of results and adjustment of measures taken are carried out by the customs authorities (their structural units) within their competence.\nThe State Customs Service determines its structural subdivision which is entrusted with the functions of coordination the application of the Risk Management System (RMS) (hereinafter - the central unit for coordination of the RMS application).\nDevelopment and implementation of practical measures for risk management are carried out taking into account the results of:\n1) risk analysis and assessment;\n2) analysis of the relevant resources and expected results of the planned activities.\nControl with the application of the RMS, carried out in accordance with Article 337 of the Customs Code of Ukraine, may be automated, non-automated and combined.\nAutomated control with the use of the RMS is carried out using information technology, including ARMS.\nNon-automated control with the use of the RMS is carried out in cases where risk assessment in a particular case of customs control of goods/vehicles cannot be carried out automatically.\nCombined control with the use of the RMS is a combination of automated and non-automated control with the use of the RMS.\nTargeting belongs to the combined control with the use of the RMS.\nAutomated and combined control with the use of the RMS is preferred when developing risk management measures.\nIn order to ensure the implementation of targeting, the targeting centers may be established at the central and/or regional levels of the State Customs Service.\nBased on the results of control with the use of the RMS, including ARMS, in each case the level of risk is determined, as well as the corresponding forms and scope of customs control to be performed by customs authorities during customs control, namely:\n- low level, at which the results of the RMS application do not establish the need for customs formalities;\n- the average level, which establishes the need for customs formalities not related to customs inspection (re-inspection) of goods/vehicles;\n- a high level, at which the need for customs formalities is established, that in particular, provide for the implementation of customs inspection (re-inspection) of goods/vehicles.\nBased on the results of control with the use of the ARMS, the customs official may be informed about the necessity to carry out customs formalities that meet one of the above listed levels of risk for the further decision-making.\n \n6.3. Risk profiles\nDepending on the possibility of their automated application, risk profiles can be documentary (non-automated control with the use of RMS) or electronic (automated or combined control with the use of RMS).\nRisk profiles are developed by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application, and are used in all customs offices (customs posts) of the State Customs Service, unless otherwise specified by the risk profile.\nCustoms authorities (their structural subdivisions) provide proposals for the development of risk profiles, in particular by entering information into the risk database.\nThe risk profile can be presented in the forms of the risk profile passport and the risk profile program code.\nThe risk profile passport is generated for documentary and electronic risk profiles and is used to document the risk profile. The content of the risk profile passport is intended for the use by customs authorities (their structural units) exclusively and is a document for official use.\nThe risk profile passport is kept for the duration of the risk profile, but not less than 3 years after its termination. Accounting, storage and use of the risk profile passports are carried out in accordance with the regulations of Ukraine governing the accounting, storage and use of documents containing official information.\nThe risk profile program code is formed only for the electronic risk profiles and is integrated into a separate module of the ARMS software.\nARMS modules are developed and implemented into the UAIS (Unified Automated Information System of Customs Authorities), including ACCS (Automated Customs Clearance System) and may take into account, in particular, customs regimes, special features, means and methods of movement across Ukraine's customs border of certain goods, vehicles, etc.\nTo report the grounds for the development of a risk profile and the risk areas that it covers, an analytical reference to the risk profile is formed. Analytical reference can be generated by the information technology, including information from the risk database.\nDepending on the need to fill in the risk profiles with the values ​​of the risk indicators, the usual (do not require filling in during application) and framework (require filling in during application) risk profiles are used. To fill in the risk profile means to determine specific values ​​of individual risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile (the list of relevant risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile is determined in the risk profile).\nIf the risk profile requires to be filled in, the risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile, the customs authority responsible for filling it in (its structural unit), the frequency of filling in/updating of the individual risk indicators and other risk profile parameters are to be indicated in the risk profile passport.\nThe risk profile may contain one or more risk-related rules. For framework risk profiles, the number of risk-related rules is determined by the number of combinations of specific values ​​of individual risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile.\nRisk profiles are filled in with ​​risk indicators values that can take into account regional and local specificities.\nBackground risk profiles allow conducting additional study and/or clarification of the risk area, monitoring of the risk area and taking prompt response measures based on the results of such monitoring. They do not involve generation of a list of customs formalities as identified in result of the application of such risk profiles. The passport of the background risk profile shall indicate the customs authority (its structural subdivision) responsible for monitoring the operation of the risk profile and the method of such monitoring.\nDevelopment of a risk profile involves:\n1) determining the risk indicators;\n2) determining the appropriateness of the use of negative and positive history in the risk profile (carried out only for electronic risk profiles);\n3) determining the algorithm for calculating the risk degree according to the risk profile and the adequate measures necessary to prevent or minimize risks (forms and scope of customs control), if the need to determine such measures is provided by the risk profile.\nDecisions on approval and implementation of electronic risk profiles, changes to them, termination of electronic risk profiles shall be made by the Expert Commission, except in cases specified in paragraph 10 of Section II of Procedure № 684. The Expert Commission shall also decide on approval and implementation of standard analysis conditions (hereinafter – SAC), making changes to them and terminating them. Decisions of the Expert Commission are made during meetings and/or by using information technology with the use of qualified electronic signatures by members of the Commission. Decisions of the Expert Commission are recorded in the minutes of the meeting and are binding to the customs authorities (their structural units).\nDocuments approved by the Expert Commission, which require program implementation by the structural unit of the State Customs Service responsible for the support of information technology (hereinafter - the structural IT unit), are made in duplicate. The first copy of the documents are sent by letter of the central unit for coordination of the RMS application to the structural IT unit for the implementation in accordance with the deadlines set in the minutes of the Expert Commission, and the second one is kept at the central unit for coordination of the RMS application.\nDocuments approved by the Expert Commission, which do not require software implementation by the structural IT unit, and that are to be implemented by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application with the use of the UAIS functionality, including ACCS, are prepared in one copy and are kept at the central unit for coordination of the RMS application.\nIf other customs authorities (their structural subdivisions) are involved in filling in or monitoring the effectiveness of the risk profile, additional duplicates of the documents may be approved or copies may be made in accordance with the established procedure.\nIn case of application of information technologies by the Expert Commission, the information on the adopted decisions, including their software implementation, may be sent with the use of the relevant information and telecommunication systems.\nThe decision to make changes into the electronic risk profile may be made by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application, if they are related to:\n1) the changes in the documents which were taken into account during the development of the risk profile, and the need to update the relevant values ​​of the individual risk profile parameters;\n2) the changes in the numerical values ​​of the positive / negative history of the risk profile, the degree of risk;\n3) the necessity to correct the technical errors in the risk profile passport.\nThe central unit for coordination of the RMS application temporarily suspends the electronic risk profile, including at the request of the customs authority (its structural subdivision), in case:\n1) the changes have been made into the documents which were taken into account during the development of the electronic risk profile, and when such changes lead to the need for significant changes in the electronic risk profile;\n2) the documents which were taken into account during the development of the electronic risk profile have been cancelled or invalidated;\n3) the electronic risk profile has lost its relevance;\n4) the problematic issues have been identified during the application of the electronic risk profile that cannot be resolved by introducing changes in accordance with paragraph 10 of Section II of the Procedure № 684;\n5) a low effectiveness of a separate risk profile has been established based on the results of RMS application.\nDecisions made in accordance with paragraphs 10, 11 of Section II of the Procedure № 684 on electronic risk profiles, the software implementation of which was carried out by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application with the use of the UAIS functionality, including ACCS, are made in the form of the reference note with the signature of the Head (or a person performing such duties) or the Deputy Head (or a person performing such duties) of the central unit for coordination of the RMS application.\nDecisions made in accordance with paragraphs 10, 11 of Section II of Procedure № 684 on electronic risk profiles, the program implementation of which was carried out by the structural IT unit, are generated in the form of a letter from the central unit for coordination of the RMS application to the structural IT unit.\nRelevant decisions are submitted for discussion at the regular meetings of the Expert Commission in order to decide on the need for further changes or termination of the risk profile.\nDecisions made in accordance with paragraph 11 of Section II of Procedure № 684 on electronic risk profiles developed by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application at the initiative of another customs authority (its structural unit), are immediately communicated to such body (unit) to take action:\n- to reconsider the values ​​of individual risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile;\n- to improve the effectiveness of the risk profile.\nIf initiator of an electronic risk profile development has not taken measures to reconsider the values ​​of individual risk indicators and other parameters of the risk profile and/or other measures to improve the effectiveness of the risk profile within a month, the termination of such risk profile is reviewed at the next meeting of the Expert Commission.\nElectronic risk profiles are communicated to the customs (customs posts) of the State Customs Service by the software methods, including in the form of ACCS updates. The electronic framework risk profile is filled in by the customs authority (its structural subdivision) responsible for filling in the relevant framework risk profile. The electronic risk profile is filled in on the basis of additions to the risk profile signed by the Head (or a person performing such duties) or Deputy Head (or a person performing such duties) of such customs authority (its structural unit). The signed additions are sent for further implementation to the structural IT unit or are made independently by the relevant customs authority (its structural unit). Decisions on approval and implementation of documentary risk profiles, changes to them, termination of documentary risk profiles are made in the manner prescribed for electronic risk profiles.\nBased on the information on the results of the risk profile application, as well as other data related to the operation of the risk profile, its effectiveness is being monitored. The risk profile passport shall include the customs authority (its structural subdivision), which is responsible for the control over the effectiveness of the risk profile, and the periodicity of such control. The general control over the risk profiles effectiveness, including with consideration of the information on the effectiveness of control carried out by the responsible customs authority (its structural subdivision) specified in the risk profile passport, is carried out by the central unit for coordination of the RMS application.\nOther interested customs authorities (their structural subdivisions) may also be involved in the control over the risk profile effectiveness at the initiative of the customs authority (its structural unit) responsible for controlling the effectiveness of the risk profile or the central unit for coordination of the RMS application.\nIn order to systematize the information on risk profiles, the central unit for coordination of the RMS application maintains a register of risk profiles with the use of information technology.\n \n6.4. Risk owner and risk management\nTo determine the forms and scope of customs control, the risk management is carried out at the strategic, tactical and operational levels.\nAt the strategic level of the risk management, based on the results of analysis, identification and assessment of risks, the State Customs Service determines the priority areas for the development and implementation of risk management measures and forms a register of risks. The risk register is reviewed and approved at a meeting of the Expert Commission on the application of the risk management system established by the State Customs Service (hereinafter referred to as the Expert Commission).\nThe risk register should contain, in particular:\n1) priority directions of development and implementation of risk management measures;\n2) information on the customs authorities (their structural units) responsible for the implementation of the relevant direction.\nAt the tactical level of risk management, customs authorities (their structural subdivisions) within their competence and based on the results of analysis, detection and assessment of risks and in accordance with the risk register develop risk management measures. The following instruments are used for this:\n1) risk profiles;\n2) guidelines;\n3) risk indicators;\n4) methodical recommendations on the work of customs officials (customs posts) on risk analysis, identification and assessment;\n5) random selection.\nAt the operational level of risk management, customs authorities (their structural subdivisions) use risk management instruments in specific cases of customs control of goods/vehicles, in particular during the control using the RMS, to determine the forms and scope of customs control.\nBased on the results of risk analysis and assessment in a particular case of movement of goods/vehicles across the customs border of Ukraine, ARMS (by performing automated control using RMS) and/or the customs officials based on the results of RMS (by performing combined and/or non-automated control with the use of RMS) choose the forms and scope of customs control. At the same time, a list of customs formalities is formed, determined by the results of applying the risk management instruments specified in paragraph 11 of Section I of the Procedure №684 (hereinafter - the List of customs formalities).\nThe forms and volumes of customs control from the List of customs formalities determined by the results of ARMS application can be changed by the Head/Deputy Head (or a person performing such duties) of the customs authority by adding activity-specific customs formalities already available in the List of customs formalities.\nBased on the results of the RMS application, the customs authority official may supplement the List of customs formalities by including customs formalities in the new area of ​​control, i.e. the area that was not identified as risky as a result of the ARMS.\nWhen using ACCS or other UAIS information system for customs control and/or customs clearance of goods/vehicles, the List of customs formalities is formed with the help of information technology, based on the results of automated control with the use of RMS, and is supplemented/changed based on the results of combined and/or non-automated control with the use of RMS by risk assessment according to documentary risk profiles, guidelines, risk indicators lists, methodological recommendations, including the results of analysis of documents submitted for customs control (their copies), available information, the results of technical means of customs control, as well as on the basis of regulations governing the procedure of customs control and/or customs clearance of goods, vehicles.\nThe List of customs formalities contains information on:\n1) the title of the customs formality;\n2) subdivision / official - initiator of inclusion of customs formalities into the list, surname, initials of the official who directly supplemented the list;\n3) the grounds for including customs formalities into the list with appropriate justifications;\n4) notification on the customs formality.\nInformation in accordance with subparagraphs 2, 3 shall be entered if the customs formality is added as a result of combined and/or non-automated control with the use of RMS by risk assessment in accordance with the documentary risk profiles, guidelines, lists of risk indicators, methodological recommendations, including documents submitted for customs control (their copies), information obtained in result of applying technical means of customs control, as well as on the basis of the legal acts requirements regulating the procedure of customs control and/or customs clearance of goods/vehicles.\nThe list of customs formalities may also not be formed at all or may contain only a notification without specifying the customs formalities.\nThe decision of the customs authority official to supplement/change the List of customs formalities is made by entering the information on certain forms and scope of customs control into the ARMS.\nCustoms officials of the State Customs Service, who carry out customs control in a particular case of customs control of goods/vehicles, must review the list of customs formalities formed with the help of information technology and supplement/change it based on the combined and/or non-automated control with the use of RMS by the risk assessment held in accordance with documentary risk profiles, guidelines, lists of risk indicators, methodological recommendations, including the analysis of documents submitted for customs control (their copies), available information, results of applying technical means of customs control, and on the basis of the legal acts requirements regulating the procedure of customs control and/or customs clearance of goods and vehicles.\nIf the List of customs formalities includes customs formalities that require involvement of officials or structural units of the customs authority that are not currently present or are not located in the place of customs control, the customs official of the State Customs Service who is designated for customs formalities, reports about such customs formalities to the superior (or his deputy) of the customs clearance unit (hereinafter - CCU), or a person performing such duties, as well as takes measures to urgently inform (including by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, etc.) certain officials or the head of the relevant structural unit of the customs authority about such customs formalities.\nAn official or the head of a structural subdivision of the customs authority, in case of receiving the relevant information, shall immediately take measures to ensure the participation of officials in the conduct of customs formalities.\nIt is also possible to remotely involve customs officials (their structural units) in conducting certain customs formalities, including the use of video surveillance systems.\nThe customs formality may be removed from the List of customs formalities if:\n1) fulfillment of the customs formality is impossible (depending on the type or characteristics of the goods, the availability of appropriate technical means, the possibility of presenting the goods for customs control, etc.);\n2) the tasks according to the notification to the customs formality were achieved during the performance of another customs formality;\n3) the customs formality and the relevant tasks in accordance with the notification to the customs formality relate to other (different from the declared) goods, vehicle or person;\n4) the possibility of non-compliance of the customs formality is provided by the law (including international legal acts).\nThe list of reasons for removing customs formalities from the List of customs formalities is formed by the Classifier of results of customs formalities that can be obtained as a result of applying the risk management system, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine № 1011dated September 20, 2012.\nThe decision to remove customs formalities from the List of customs formalities is made by the Head (Deputy Head) of the CCU, or a person performing such duties, except when customs regulations specify other requirements.\nIn case of applying targeting (the risk analysis and assessment method according to which foreign trade transactions or movements across the customs border of Ukraine which have been previously analyzed with the use of information technology, including ARMS, are subject to additional risks assessment with the use information available to customs authorities (their structural units) for the risk management purpose) the decision to change the List of customs formalities or to cancel certain customs formalities may be made by the targeter or his immediate superior/his deputy (or a person performing such duties).\nThe official who made the decision, records it in the UAIS, including the ACCS, with the obligatory justification of the decision.\nUpon completion of customs formalities from the List of customs formalities, information on the results of all customs formalities is entered using the ACCS or other UAIS information system into the database of the customs authority (except for customs formalities that can be completed after customs clearance).\nThe results of customs formalities that are added into the List of customs formalities by the customs authority official after acceptance of customs declaration for registration, shall be entered by such customs authority official or his immediate superior/or his deputy (or a person performing such duties).\nIt is envisaged to enter the following information on the results of customs formalities from the List of customs formalities:\n1) the result of customs formality;\n2) the date of actual completion of the customs formality or the date of the decision to cancel it;\n3) surnames, initials of officials who have completed the customs formality, or the official who decided to cancel it;\n4) additional information on the results of customs formalities, which the official considers appropriate to indicate (to describe the result in more detail, indicate problematic issues during the application of customs formalities, etc.) - is indicated if necessary. Entering additional information is mandatory if:\n- a decision was made to cancel customs formalities (in this case it is necessary to indicate the relevant comprehensive justification);\n- the results of customs formality revealed discrepancies/offenses (in such case it is necessary to indicate detailed information on the nature of the identified discrepancies/offenses);\n5) details of the documents confirming the completion of customs formality - if such documents are drawn up as a result of customs formalities (inspection report, decision of the customs authority to determine the product code, etc.), except for those already listed in column 44 of the customs declaration, namely:\n- title of the document;\n- date and number of the document;\n- additional information about the document, which the official person considers appropriate to indicate (specified title of the document, information about its publisher, etc.), is indicated if necessary.\nIt is obligatory to enter the results of all customs formalities from the List of customs formalities.\nThe following approach is used when entering information on the results of customs formalities:\n1) in terms of the actual execution, it is taken into account that such information is entered about the current consignment of goods and the scope of customs control performed by this CCU is considered. Thus, if during the current customs clearance there is a customs formality present in the List of customs formalities and relevant tasks related to it, which this CCU has performed earlier (according to the customs declaration, the customs clearance of which was not completed due to revocation or refusal of customs clearance, etc.), such customs formality is considered to be completed, which is duly recorded in the ACCS or other UAIS information system. If during the current customs clearance there is a customs formality present in the List of customs formalities and relevant tasks related to it, which were previously performed by other CCU, including at the checkpoint on the state border of Ukraine, and this CCU does not take additional measures, such customs formality is considered incomplete and requires a decision on the cancelation of the customs formality, which is duly recorded in the ACCS or other UAIS information system;\n2) in terms of identifying discrepancies/offenses, it is taken into account that such information is entered for the current consignment of goods and the current customs declaration.\nThe targeter may determine the need to inform the target center about the completion of customs formalities by ticking the appropriate mark in the ACCS or other UAIS information system.\nIn case of detection of incorrect operation (errors) of the ARMS, as a result of which the forms and scope of customs control cannot be determined automatically, the State Customs Service official performs non-automated control with the use of RMS by assessing risk according to the documentary risk profiles, guidelines, lists of risk indicators, methodological recommendations, including the results of analysis of the documents submitted for customs control (their copies), available information, the results of the use of technical means of customs control, as well as the requirements of legal acts governing customs control and/or customs clearance of goods and vehicles, and in case of identification of grounds for determining the forms and scope of customs control, forms the List of customs formalities independently.\n \n6.5. Post audit activities (fulfillment by customs officials of the formalities determined by the results of the RMS)\nIn order to reduce the selectivity of ARMS risk profiles during customs control, automated assignment of business entities depending on their characteristics is carried out online.\nAutomated assignment of business entities is based on the results of verification of compliance with the established criteria using information technology, in particular ARMS, whereas the customs-related and other information obtained by customs authorities in the manner prescribed by law is being used.\nFor the business entities, depending on their correspondence to the certain criteria and their values, the coefficients of reduction of the ARMS determining of the need for customs inspection and/or additional verification of documents are applied.\nBusiness entities are assessed for compliance with certain criteria automatically in each case at the time of customs control of goods/vehicles.\nProvisions of the Procedure № 684 on electronic risk profiles and the ones regarding considerations and approvals at a meeting of the Expert Commission, cover the list of criteria that characterize the business entity and their meaning.\nThe list of criteria according to which the automated assignment of business entities is carried out is published by the State Customs Service on its website.\nThe results of the automated assignment of business entities do not exclude the possibility of random selection and/or targeting.\nDuring the customs control of goods and vehicles, the State Customs Service officials ensure the implementation of the List of customs formalities formed on the basis of the implemented risk management measures for customs control and/or customs clearance provided for in Section VII of Procedure № 684.\nThe State Customs Service official performs customs formalities from the List of customs formalities, taking into account the notification to the customs formality, as well as in accordance with the requirements of regulations governing customs control and/or customs clearance of goods/vehicles, as well as guidelines in the relevant area of ​​control, etc.\nThe customs formality from the List of customs formalities, which provides for additional verification of documents in a particular area of ​​control, is carried out during the relevant control in this area in the manner prescribed by regulations of Ukraine on customs matters.\nIn case of discovering new information in the process of customs inspection (re-inspection) of goods and vehicles, which may be decisive during the control in certain areas (in particular, checking the correct classification of goods, correctness of determining the country of origin, compliance with declared non-tariff measures regulation, the presence of declared goods in the customs register of intellectual property rights, the correct application of tax benefits, the correctness of the customs value of goods), the State Customs Service official conducts re-control in this area based on such information.\nIf it is necessary to conduct a customs inspection (re-inspection) of goods and vehicles in excess of the List of customs formalities, the State Customs Service official adds the appropriate customs formality into the List of customs formalities.\nIn such case, the result of customs formalities with less control is recorded taking into account the implementation of customs formalities with more control.\nDepending on the identified risks, the customs inspection (re-inspection) may be carried out on some or all of the goods moved in a particular foreign trade transaction.\nCustoms inspection (re-inspection) of all goods may even be carried out if only certain goods are indicated in the notification to the customs formality (for example, in case of detection of risks of declaring goods not by their titles).\nWhen determining the scope of customs inspection (re-inspection) of goods, the official is guided by the notification to the relevant customs formality.\nOfficials of customs bodies (their structural subdivisions) during the RMS application are obliged to:\n1) comply with the Constitution of Ukraine and act exclusively in accordance with the Customs Code of Ukraine and other laws of Ukraine, other regulations and requirements of the Procedure № 684;\n2) comply with the information confidentiality requirements regarding risk analysis and assessment, development and implementation of risk management measures to determine the forms and scope of customs control (except cases provided by the laws of Ukraine);\n3) ensure full and high-quality implementation of customs formalities determined by the results of the RMS application;\n4) reliably enter information into the ACCS and/or other UAIS information system that directly or indirectly affects the results of risk analysis and assessment.\nOfficials of customs authorities (their structural subdivisions) during the RMS application are not allowed to:\n1) edit documents, video, photo and other materials in order to distort information about the results of customs formalities;\n2) without an authorization, interfere into the work of the ACCS with software tools, other than the ASMO, in order to distort or destroy the RMS results;\n3) deliberately stop the ACCS services (information input-output, etc.), interfere with the operation of network equipment in order to ensure limited or complete absence of ARMS functionality.\nIf goods/commercial vehicles moved by the company across the customs border of Ukraine in more than 25% of such movements during a year were subject to customs control due to the application of risk management system, which delayed customs clearance for more than 4 working hours, and whereas the infringement of customs rules were not detected, this company has the right to know the reasons and grounds for the application of the relevant forms of customs control to these goods/vehicles.\n \n \n \n6.6. Container control program (CCP)\n \nThe Container Control Program (CCP) of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was established as a joint initiative of UNODC and the World Customs Organization (WMO) in 2004. Faced with such a complex and globalized problem, the CCP takes a nuanced, holistic and multi-sectoral approach, providing continuous monitoring and supervision, offering a variety of context-sensitive training programs and strengthening cooperation between public institutions and the private sector. The CCP's mission is to build capacity in Member States seeking to improve risk management, security of supply chain and trade facilitation at seaports, airports and land border crossings to prevent the movement of illegal goods across the borders.\nThe CCP currently operates in more than 70 Member States. Since the establishment of the CCP in 2004, more than 120 of Port Control Units (PCU) and Air Cargo Control Units (ACCU) have been established. These interagency units are equipped with the ContainerComm, a secure communication application developed by WMO and designed to share information with their counterparts in other countries. This gives the PCU and ACCU access to a large amount of information, allowing users to share information about high-risk containers and verify their identification numbers.\nThese efforts have led to the seizure of a wide range of illicit goods, such as weapons and ammunition, revenues from fisheries, forests, wildlife and other environmental crimes, illicit drugs, strategic goods, counterfeit or unlicensed medications, precursors for drug and explosives, cigarettes, alcohol , stolen vehicles and goods that are counterfeit or otherwise violate intellectual property law. The CCP remains an ideal place to support strengthening the security of the international supply chain by building the capacity of national border administrations to withstand threats from sea, land and air cargo.\nThe first unit within the framework of the Global Container Control Program in Ukraine was established on January 16, 2018 in the port of Odessa. The Port Control Unit, consisting of 5 employees from the Odessa Customs of the State Fiscal Service and the Southern Regional Department of the State Border Guard Service, works to prevent the illegal movement of contraband drugs, weapons, counterfeit goods, dual-use goods, flora and fauna using sea containers and other criminal activity. The second group was created in the area of ​​activity of Kyiv Customs at Boryspil Airport. This is not about additional control. The group is provided with all necessary technical means of control, in particular, a mobile laboratory for rapid analysis of chemical and physical characteristics, survey tools, has access to national and international databases, which allows analytical work to select containers at potential risk i.e. the ones which may contain narcotic drugs, dual-use items.\nThese units analyze preliminary information provided by maritime and aviation agents based on national and international databases (CTS-International Risk System, WCO IPM and PICS - data exchange on counterfeit products and precursor circulation). After that, the selection of risky movements of goods in containers, generalization and analysis of available information are held.\nOn the basis of the received information, the decision on additional forms of customs control is made. This can be either an additional check of documents, or scanning, weighing, customs inspection, the use of canine teams.\n\n\n Section 7. Interaction of the Customs Service with the authorities, agencies and stakeholders\n \nAccording to the Regulation on the State Customs Service of Ukraine, the SCS implements the state customs policy, the state policy in the field of combating offenses by applying customs legal framework. According to the Customs Code of Ukraine (CCU), the purpose of customs authorities is to create favorable conditions for the development of foreign economic activity, ensure public safety, protect the customs interests of Ukraine, prevent and counter smuggling, fight against violations of customs rules throughout the customs territory of Ukraine. For this purpose, among other things, the customs authorities interact with the authorities of Ukraine, law enforcement agencies, foreign trade entities, carriers and natural persons, maintain customs statistics and exchange data with the customs authorities of other countries, exchange documents and information with other state authorities of Ukraine, customs, law enforcement and other bodies of foreign countries.\nTaking into account the objectives of this Handbook, this section will cover the general aspects of the interaction of customs with law enforcement agencies and participants of foreign economic operations - applicants or customs representatives, carriers, authorized economic operators.\n \n7.1.   Inter-Agency Cooperation\nCooperation of the Customs Service with law enforcement agencies to fight against violations of customs rules.\nAccording to the Regulation on the State Customs Service, in order to fulfill the tasks assigned to it, the SCS has, among other things, the right:\n- to take special measures, in particular, in cooperation with foreign bodies and state bodies of Ukraine, which have the right to conduct operative and investigative activities;\n- participate in inspections and other measures carried out by state bodies;\n- to the scope limited by the law, to involve experts, specialists of central and local executive bodies, enterprises, institutions and organizations (if agreed by their managers), scientists, representatives of civil society institutions (by mutual consent) into consideration of issues that belong to the competence of the SCS.\nThe law enforcement agencies with which the customs authorities actively interact in the process of fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the law include: the National Police, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Prosecutor's Office, and the Border Guard. The main powers of law enforcement agencies are systematized and defined in Chapter 77 of the Customs Code of Ukraine (CCU).\nOne of the most common violations of customs rules is the illegal movement of goods (secretly or in violation of rules and procedures, or the movement of goods whose movement is prohibited or restricted), or smuggling. As part of the fight against smuggling, including of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors, controlled deliveries of said drugs, substances and precursors, as well as the movement of goods under covert control and operational supervision of law enforcement agencies, can be carried out by customs authorities together with state bodies that have the right to carry out operational and investigative activities.\n \n\n\t\n\nRegarding measures toprevent and combat smuggling, see Chapter 66 of the CCU.\n\n \nThe interaction of customs authorities with law enforcement agencies is determined by Art. 558 of the CCU. Among other things, it states that:\n- customs bodies, when performing their tasks, interact, including by exchanging information, with law enforcement agencies;\n- if during customs control or other measures carried out by the customs authorities, the signs of offenses are detected, the investigation of which does not belong to the powers of the customs authorities, the customs authorities are obliged to notify the relevant law enforcement authorities in writing;\n- law enforcement agencies are obliged to notify the customs authorities in writing about violations of customs rules or contraband detected by them;\n- law enforcement agencies are obliged to notify the customs authorities in writing about the availability of operational information regarding possible cases of movement of goods, including vehicles for personal use, commercial vehicles in violation of Ukrainian legislation;\n- the customs authorities are obliged to provide the State Border Service of Ukraine with instructions to inform the customs authorities about the intention of crossing the state border of Ukraine by persons in respect of whom the customs authorities have detected a violation of customs rules, if the persons who are brought to administrative responsibility for the violation of customs rules were not present when drawing up a protocol on violation of customs rules;\n- the customs authorities are obliged to provide the State Border Service of Ukraine and the authorities of the National Police with the information about vehicles and persons in respect of whom the customs authorities have detected a violation of the terms of temporary importation of vehicles and/or the terms of movement of vehicles in the customs transit regime, if the persons who are hold liable to administrative responsibility for violation of customs rules, were not present when the protocol on violation of customs rules was drawn up.\nAnother important aspect of interaction in the context of customs control is the coordination in the field of canine support (border and customs control), as for the use of information technologies and operation of common infrastructure, and coordination at the level of using the software on the single platform.\nAs part of the use of the single platform, the state created the \"Single Window\" system, which, among other things, increases the level of control over the movement of goods subject to export control through the customs territory of Ukraine, by placing licenses and permits/conclusions for export (import) of goods into the system in the form of an electronic document certified by an electronic digital signature. In its turn, the Central executive authority (CEA) in the field of customs affairs on a monthly basis submits information on the scope of export (import) of goods under the issued licenses, permits/conclusions to the CEA, which ensures the formation and implementation of state policy in the field of economic development (Ministry of Economy of Ukraine).\nThe representative(s) of the customs service are also included into the composition of the Interdepartmental Commission on International Trade, which, among other things, carries out state regulation of foreign economic activity, including by changing the conditions of movement of goods across the customs border in order to combat violations of customs rules.\n \n\n\t\n\nAbout the Interdepartmental Commissionon International Trade, see Article 5 of the Law of Ukraine \"On the Protection of NationalProduct Producers from Dumping Imports\" No.330-XIV of 22.12.1998.\n\n \nAccording to the second part of Article 5 of the Law of Ukraine \"On the Protection of National Product Producers from Dumping Imports\" No. 330-XIV dated 22.12.1998, the list of the personnel of the Interdepartmental Commission on International Trade is approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine upon its submission by the Chairman of this Commission.\n\n\t\n\nFor the current composition of theInterdepartmental Commission on International Trade, see Resolutionof the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \"On Approval of the Compositionof the Interdepartmental Commission on International Trade\" No.310 dated18.04.2012.\n\n \nInternational cooperation is another aspect of the fight against violation of customs rules. An example of such cooperation is the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), which began its work in 2005. Within its framework, a Pre-arrival information exchange system (PAIES) was introduced, which allows the customs services of Moldova and Ukraine to exchange electronic information on the import and export of goods that cross the common border. Due to PAIES, the customs services of both countries can better control goods crossing the common border, including on the Transnistrian segment. This system made it possible to reduce violations of customs rules.\n \nCooperation of the Customs Service with state authorities in the process of decision-making regarding the issuance of permits and export control.\nIn accordance with the Law of Ukraine \"On State Control of International Transfers of Military Purpose and Dual-Use Goods\" No.549-IV dated 20.02.2003, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC of Ukraine) coordinates activities and exercises control over the actions of executive authorities in the field of state export control. Implementation of the state policy in the field of export control is ensured by the CEA, which implements the state policy in the field of state export control (such CEA is the State Export Control Service of Ukraine, hereinafter - SSECU), as well as ministries, other CEAs, intelligence agencies of Ukraine authorized by law to implement measures in the field of state export control. The SSECU receives from other executive bodies the information necessary to exercise its powers in the field of state export control.\nThe superior state body in terms of decision-making regarding the granting of permits for international transfers of military and dual use goods is the Interdepartmental Commission on the Policy of Military and Technical Cooperation and Export Control under the NSDC of Ukraine.\n \n\n\t\nAbout the Interdepartmental Commission on the Policy of Military and Technical Cooperation and Export Control at the NSDC of Ukraine, see the Regulation on the Interdepartmental Commission on the Policy of Military and Technical Cooperation and Export Control, approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine No.180/2007dated March 5, 2007.\n \nIn accordance with paragraph 6 of the Regulation on the Interdepartmental Commission on the Policy of Military and Technical Cooperation and Export Control, approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine No.180/2007 of March 5, 2007, the members of this Commission are representatives of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, a representative of the Office of the President of Ukraine, as well as the First Deputy or Deputy of the Minister of Economy of Ukraine, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the Chairman of the State Export Control Service, the First Deputy or Deputy Chairman of the State Customs Service of Ukraine, the Head of the State Space Agency of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine , the Head of the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as the Director General of the State Concern \"Ukroboronprom\".\nThus, the State Customs Service of Ukraine is involved in the decision-making procedure regarding the granting of permits for international transfers of military and dual use goods at the highest level, which is legally enacted in the above-mentioned national legal acts.\n \nInter alia, the task of this Commission is to prepare proposals regarding:\n- improvement of coordination and implementation of control over activities of executive authorities in the field of state export control;\n- drafts of normative legal acts, concepts, state programs, international treaties of Ukraine on the issues of military-technical cooperation and export control;\n- solving problematic issues of military-technical cooperation and export control.\nThe Commission, among other things:\n- analyzes the effectiveness of state regulation of activities in the field of military and technical cooperation and export control and develops proposals for its improvement;\n- in accordance with the established procedure elaborates proposals regarding the granting of powers to subjects of foreign economic activity of Ukraine for the right to export/ import military and dual-use goods;\n- monitors compliance of Ukraine's international obligations and agreements on military and technical cooperation and export control by executive authorities and subjects of international transfers of military and dual use goods;\n- participates in the preparation and examination of draft legal acts on the implementation of state policy in the field of military and technical cooperation and export control, as well as in the coordination of the relevant draft acts of the President of Ukraine;\n- according to the established procedure is involved into the consideration of issues regarding the provision of permissions to conduct negotiations related to the conclusion of foreign economic agreements (contracts) for the implementation of international transfers of military and dual use goods, permits for the implementation of international transfers of such goods.\n \nInteraction of the Customs Service of Ukraine with the SSECU should be separately noted as another aspect of cooperation of the Customs Service with the state bodies of Ukraine in terms of decision-making on granting permits in the field of export control.\nThus, the Instruction on the procedure for issuing and using permit documents in the field of state export control was approved by the Order of the SSECU No.355 dated November 29, 2004. According to it:\n- the State Customs Service of Ukraine shall receive a complete description of the elements of protection of permit documents against forgery (prior to their implementation), as well as samples of signatures of relevant officials of the State Export Control Service and impressions of seals;\n- the State Export Control Service shall promptly inform the State Customs Service of Ukraine about the cancellation or suspension of the granted permit or conclusion according to the law;\n- the State Customs Service of Ukraine shall promptly inform the State Export Control Service in writing of the detention by the customs authorities of goods moving across the customs border of Ukraine on the basis of a permit or conclusion of the State Export Control Service, for reasons related to export control, indicating the reasons for the detention. The decision on the further use of such a permit or conclusion is made by the State Export Control Service;\n- in case of partial (not full) use of the permit document, the necessity of making changes to it, including extending its validity period, is considered by the State Export Control Service after the applicant provides a copy of this document together with information about the state of its actual use, certified by the signature of the head or deputy head of the customs body and the original seal of this body.\nThus, the State Customs Service has a wide range of interdepartmental cooperation in the field of export control, in particular it participates both in the decision-making process on the granting of permit documents at the highest level of state decision-making, and in the technical process of issuing permits/conclusions for the movement of goods subject to export control.\n \n7.2.   Relationship of the customs authority with the stakeholders\nAccording to clause 1 of Article 562 of the CCU, customs authorities establish and maintain official relations of a consultative nature with business entities. The main part of these relations is the customs formalities for crossing the border by the goods of legal entities. These procedures, in addition to the legal entity, in almost all cases include the declarant or authorized person (customs broker), as well as the carrier.\nAccording to the definitions of the Customs Code of Ukraine:\n- declarant is a person who independently makes the declaration or on whose behalf the declaration is made;\n- a customs broker is an enterprise that provides services on the declaration of goods, vehicles for commercial purposes that move across the customs border of Ukraine.\nAt the same time, the customs broker is represented at the customs office by a customs agent - a natural person - a resident who is in labor relations with the customs broker and directly performs actions related to the presentation of goods and vehicles of commercial purpose as well as documents required for their customs control and customs clearance to the customs authority in the interests of the person represented by the customs broker.\nThus, a legal entity has the goods declared by its employees, or entrusts this operation to a third party. It should be noted that the only significant difference in the interaction between customs and the declarant and customs and the broker is that the brokerage activity is controlled by the customs authorities and it is necessary to obtain an appropriate permit for its implementation. Also, when carrying out customs clearance by a broker, the latter must documentally confirm his right to carry out customs formalities on behalf of a legal entity. In other aspects, the interaction between the customs broker and the declarant (essentially a legal entity) does not differ.\nAccording to the CCU, the following occurs within the framework of the relationship between customs and the declarant/broker:\n- informing interested parties about customs regulations, in particular with the use of information technologies;\n- consulting on customs issues;\n- provision of certificates by the customs authorities at the request of interested persons;\n- provision by the customs of preliminary decisions on the application of certain legal provisions of Ukraine on customs matters;\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nSuch decisions are made before the beginning of the movement of goods across the customs border of Ukraine and are mandatory for implementation by any customs authority.\n\nFor more detailed information on preliminary decisions, see Article 23 of the CCU.\n\n \n-         obtaining of customs permits for operations with goods in \"transit\" mode (overloading from one vehicle to another, grouping of packaging units, change of packaging, marking, sorting, repair/change of damaged packaging);\n \n\n\t\n\nFor more detailed information on the seoperations, see Article 96 of the CCU.\n\n \n-         obtaining of customs permit to transfer goods into the mode of destruction, as well as to refuse in favor of the state;\n-         placement of goods in customs warehouses;\n-         obtaining of customs permits for operations in the customs territory of Ukraine and outside of it, including determination of processing terms and their extension in accordance with the CCU;\n \n\n\t\n\nFor more detailed information on the seoperations, see Articles 23, 24 of the CCU.\n\n \n-         obtaining of customs permits for the temporary import and export of goods with the determination of the term of such import/export and the extension of this term in accordance with the CCU;\n\n\t\n\nFor more detailed information on the seoperations, see Article 18,19 of the CCU.\n\n \n-         issuance by customs of movement (origin) certificates for Eur.1 goods;\n \n\n\t\n\nThe procedure for filling out and issuing of the movement (origin) certificate for EUR 1 or EUR-MED goods by customs is approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.139dated March 2, 2021.\n\n \n-         issuance by customs of delivery confirmation certificates;\n\n\t\n\nThe form of certificates and the procedure for their issuance is determined by the Decreeof the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.920 dated 27.05.1999. \n\n \n-         obtaining of customs permits for conducting customs brokering activities, opening and operating customs warehouses, temporary storage warehouses, duty-free shops, cargo customs complexes, commercial or service-type free customs zones.\nIn terms of the interaction between customs and carriers, it should be noted that the Customs Code of Ukraine of 2002 provided for the concept \"customs carrier\" (an enterprise that carried out the transportation of goods subject to customs control between the customs authorities, without applying at the same time measures to guarantee the delivery of goods to the customs authority of destination). The status of a customs carrier was granted only to resident enterprises and required obtaining a corresponding license from the customs authorities of Ukraine. The Customs Code of Ukraine of the 2012 edition does not provide for the concept \"customs carrier\". To date, the issuance of a certificate of admission for a road vehicle to the transportation of goods under customs stamps and seals is provided for vehicles which owners carry out road transportation under the terms of the Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods using the TIR Carnet of 1975 (TIR Convention).\n \n\n\t\n\nThe Procedure for issuing a certificate on the admission of a road vehicle to the transportation of goods under customs stamps and seals was approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.1064dated 09.10.2012. \n\n \nOther aspects of the interaction between customs authorities and carriers include:\n- control by the customs of the terms of delivery by the carrier of goods that are under the customs control;\n- obtaining of permits from customs authorities for loading and unloading of goods transported by cabotage;\n- the change of cargo vehicles or drivers operating them;\n- unloading of goods at the warehouse of the customs authorities (subject to their permission), if the goods delivered by the carrier, which are under customs control, have not been declared by the responsible person to any customs regime within three days;\n- cooperation in the fulfillment of customs formalities in the event of an accident or force majeure.\nAccording to the CCU, a resident enterprise that performs any role in the international supply chain of goods (manufacturer, exporter, importer, customs representative, carrier, forwarder, warehouse keeper) can obtain the status of an authorized economic operator (AEO). There are 2 types of AEO:\n1) AEO-C – AEO that has the right to apply special simplifications;\n2) AEO-B – AEO that confirmed safety and reliability.\nThe enterprise has the right to obtain both types of authorization at the same time.\nThe decision to grant, refuse to grant, suspend (renew) or cancel the AEO authorization is issued by an order of the CEA which maintains the Unified State Register of Authorized Economic Operators and ensures its publication on its official website.\nAn enterprise that has received AEO authorization has the right to apply special simplifications and use the benefits. The procedure and conditions of their application are determined by the CCU.\n \n\n\t\n\nThe list of special simplifications and advantages is provided in Article 13 of the CCU. \n\n \nAs part of its activities, the AEO upon written request and in accordance with the procedure defined by Article 131 of the CCU, obtains permits for the application of special simplifications from the customs authority and is obliged to immediately inform the customs office, which has granted permission for the application of the corresponding special simplification, about all events and circumstances that may have an effect on the AEO's compliance with the conditions specified by such a permit.\nAfter granting an AEO authorization to an enterprise, the customs authorities carry out a set of measures that ensure systematic control of the enterprise's compliance with the AEO criteria (compliance monitoring).\n \n\n\t\n\nThe procedure for the compliance monitoring is determined by Article 16 of the CCU. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Liability for violation of customs rules and procedures\n \nThe problem of violations and combating the illegal movement of goods is one of the priority tasks of any state, since illegal actions can affect the expansion of the shadow sector of the economy, harm both the economic and security sectors of the state.\nThe issue of customs offenses, finding of effective mechanisms for combating them is regulated by the relevant normative legal acts of Ukraine, which contain procedures for the application of procedural actions aimed at bringing offenders to justice.\nAccording to the Regulation on the State Customs Service of Ukraine, its main tasks include ensuring the implementation of state policy in the field of combating offenses during the application of legislation on state customs matters, preventing and countering smuggling, and combating violations of customs rules.\n \n\n\t\n\nYou can familiarize yourself with the Regulation on the State Customs Service of Ukraine by following the link https://customs.gov.ua/polozhennia \n\n \nIt is worth noting that violations of customs rules belong to the category of administrative offenses. Thus, the Customs Code of Ukraine (hereinafter - the Code), in particular, Art. 458 defines that \"violation of customs rules is an administrative offense, which constitutes illegal, culpable (intentional or negligent) actions or inactions that encroach the established by the Customs Code of Ukraine and other legal acts of Ukraine procedure of movement of goods, commercial vehicles through the customs border of Ukraine, presenting them to the customs authorities for customs control and customs clearance, as well as carrying out operations with goods that are under customs control or the control of which is entrusted to the customs authorities, and for which the Customs Code of Ukraine provides administrative responsibility.\"\nHowever, administrative responsibility for the offenses provided by the Code takes place unless these offenses entail criminal liability.\nArticle 459 of the Code stipulates that citizens who have reached the age of 16 at the time of committing such an offense may be held administratively liable for violating customs rules, and in case of violating customs rules by enterprises - officials of these enterprises. In addition, foreigners and stateless persons staying on the territory of Ukraine are also subject to prosecution for violation of customs rules.\nThe legislation establishes that an act committed in a state of extreme necessity, i.e. with the aim of eliminating a danger that threatens the state or public order, property, rights and freedoms of citizens, does not fall under the violation of customs rules.\nAt the same time, an offense does not occur if the cargo is not delivered to the customs office of destination due to an accident or force majeure. In such circumstances, the carrier is obliged to take all possible measures to preserve the goods and prevent any use of them, notify the nearest customs authority and have documentary confirmation.\nNorms establishing responsibility for violation of customs rules are contained in Chapter XVIII of the Code \"Violations of customs rules and liability for them\". Chapter XIX \"Proceedings in cases on violation of customs rules\" covers liability of persons involved in cases on violation of customs rules.\nBased on the above, the Code applies three types of administrative sanctions - warning, fine and confiscation of goods (commercial vehicles). A warning and a fine can be applied only as the main administrative penalty, confiscation – both as the main and as an additional administrative penalty. However, for one and the same violation of customs rules, only the main or the main and additional administrative penalty can be imposed.\nA warning (Article 463 of the Code) is an official appeal to the offender with the aim of preventing him from committing similar acts in the future. A warning contains legal consequences, i.e. in the case of repeated committing of a similar offense during the year for which a person was subject to a penalty in the form of a warning, the imposition of such a penalty is considered a circumstance that aggravates responsibility.\nHowever, the Code applies warnings to a relatively small number of violations, namely the sanctions of Article 468 \"Violation of the regime of the customs control zone\", part 1 of Art. 469 \"Illegal transactions with goods, means of transport, the customs clearance of which has not been completed, or with goods temporarily stored under customs control\", part 1 of Art. 470 \"Non-delivery of goods, commercial vehicles and documents to the customs authority of destination, their issuance without the permission of the customs authority or loss\", part 1 of Article 481 \"Exceeding the term of temporary import or temporary export of goods\".\nA fine (Article 464 of the Code) as a type of administrative penalty consists in imposing on a person the obligation to pay money in the amount determined by the classification and nature of the offense committed.\nThe procedure for calculating fines in the Code is established in the amount divisible by non-taxable minimum incomes (the non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens is determined by Ukrainian laws, hereinafter - NTMI) and in percentage equivalent.\nConfiscation of goods (Article 465 of the Code) as an administrative penalty involves the forced seizure of goods, vehicles and their free transfer into state ownership.\nIn addition, part 1 of Art. 511 of the Customs Code of Ukraine establishes that goods that are direct objects of violation of customs rules and the relevant documents that are required as evidence in the case of violation of customs rules may be temporarily seized. Documents that are in electronic form are confiscated along with the corresponding media.\nPart 2 of the same article specifies the obligation to temporarily seize goods, commercial vehicles, as well as relevant documentary materials. Such measures are applied in case of detection of the following violations:\n- in case of exceeding the delivery term of vehicles for personal use and commercial vehicles by more than 30 days, as well as the loss of these vehicles, including their disassembly (part 6 of Article 470 of the Code);\n- in case of non-declaration of goods (except for currency values) that are subject to prohibitions and/or restrictions established by law regarding their import/export into/outside the customs territory of Ukraine and which are moved by citizens (part 3 of Article 471 of the Code);\n- in case of non-declaration of goods, commercial vehicles (Article 472 of the Code);\n- when forwarding through the customs border of Ukraine in international postal and express shipments of goods prohibited for such forwarding (Article 473 of the Code);\n- when moving goods across the customs border of Ukraine in violation of intellectual property rights (Article 476 of the Code);\n- in case of exceeding the term of temporary importation of vehicles for personal use and vehicles of commercial purpose into the customs territory of Ukraine by more than 30 days, as well as the loss of these vehicles, including their dismantling (part 6 of Article 481 of the Code);\n- during movement or actions aimed at movement of goods, vehicles of commercial purpose across the customs border of Ukraine outside customs control (Article 482 of the Code);\n- during movement or actions aimed at movement of goods across the customs border of Ukraine with concealment from customs control (Article 483 of the Code);\n- when storing, transporting or purchasing goods, commercial vehicles imported into the customs territory of Ukraine outside of customs control or with concealment from customs control (Article 484 of the Code).\nPart 3 of Article 511 of the Code defines that if a customs offense is committed by a person who does not have permanent residence or address in Ukraine, goods and means of transport shall be seized in a quantity sufficient for recovering a fine or cost of goods and means of transport.\nSeized goods, means of transport and documents shall be listed in a report compiled in cases stipulated by this Code or in a description attached thereto specifying the exact quantity, measure, weight and special features of such goods, means of transport and documents, as well as the cost of goods and means of transport (part 4 of Article 511 of the Code).\nIt is worth noting that the Code also provides that the temporary seizure of goods, vehicles and documents can be appealed. The appeal procedure is defined in Chapter 4 of the Code (Appeals against decisions, acts or omissions by the revenue and duties authorities, officials and other employees, and their accountability) and other laws of Ukraine.\nThe table below shows the types of offenses and sanctions (norms of responsibility) for their commission.\nTable 1\n\nArt. of the CCU\n\n\t\n\nOffense\n\n\t\n\nResponsibility \n\n\n\n\n468\n\n\t\n\nViolation of the procedure of customs control area\n\nEconomic activities carried out in the customs control area, movement of goods and means of transport across and within the customs control area, crossing of the customs control area by citizens who do not cross the customs border of Ukraine and officials of the public authorities that are not engaged in controls and their movement within that area in violation of the procedure laid down in Article 332 of the Code.\n\n\t\n\n \n\nA warning or a fine amounting to 20 NTMI.\n\n\n\n\n469\n\n\t\n\nUnlawful handling of goods withpending customs clearance or goods placed for temporary warehousing undercustoms supervision, or of personal transport vehicles temporarily importedinto the customs territory of Ukraine or placed under the customs regime oftransit.  \n\nDependingon the classification of offense mentioned in part 1-4 of this of the Code. \n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA warning or a fine amounting from 20 to 2000 NTMI. \n\n\n\n\n470\n\n\t\n\nNon-delivery of goods, means of personal transport, commercial vehicles and documents to the customs authority of destination, their release without the authorization of the customs authority or loss.  \n\nSanctions are established depending on the classification of the violation set out in Parts 1-6 of this Article of the Code, in particular, exceeding the terms of delivery of goods, their loss, disassembly, repeated violations of the term of delivery of goods imposed by Article 95 of the CCU, including vehicles for personal use, vehicles of commercial purpose, which are under customs control, to the customs office of destination.\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA warning or a fine amounting from 10 to 10000 NTMI or seizure of vehicles \n\n\n\n\n471\n\n\t\n\nViolation of the customs control rules in the simplified customs control zones (green channels)\n\n\t\n\nA fine amounting to 100 NTMI, and if direct objects of the offenses are goods whose movement across the customs border of Ukraine is prohibited or restricted by the legislation of Ukraine, it shall also entail a confiscation of goods.\n\n\n\n\n472\n\n\t\n\nFailure to declare goods, means of transport for commercial use.\n\n\t\n\nA fine amounting to 100 per cent of the cost of such goods, means of transport with their confiscation.\n\n\n\n\n473\n\n\t\n\nSending of goods prohibited for sending by international mail and express mail across the customs border of Ukraine\n\n\t\n\nConfiscation of goods.\n\n\n\n\n474\n\n\t\n\nImpeding the customs officials toaccess goods, means of transport, documents\n\n\t\n\nAfine amounting to 100 NTMI, repeated offence during one year – a fine of 500NTMI\n\n\n\n\n475\n\n\t\n\nFailure to report on goods placedunder customs supervision to the customs authority\n\n\t\n\nAfine amounting to 50 NTMI\n\n\n\n\n476\n\n\t\n\nMovement of goods across thecustoms border of Ukraine with infringement of intellectual property rights\n\n\t\n\nAfine amounting to 1000 NTMI with confiscation of goods moved withinfringement of intellectual property rights. \n\n\n\n\n477\n\n\t\n\nViolation of legally establishedrules for importation / exportation of goods into / from the territory offree customs zone and/or legally established rules for handling of goodsplaced under the procedure of free customs zone\n\n\t\n\nAfine amounting to 1000 NTMI\n\n\n\n\n478\n\n\t\n\nViolation of the procedure forstorage of goods in customs warehouses and their handling \n\nCommissionof offenses stipulated by part 2 of Article 127 of the Code (preparation ofgoods for sale and transport, i.e. consolidation and fragmentation ofconsignments, formation of consignments, sorting, packing, re-packing,marking, loading, unloading, reloading, sampling and other similaractivities).\n\nCommissionof offenses stipulated by part 5 of Article 129 of the Code (the goods drawnup under the customs shall be brought out of the customs territory of Ukraineor placed under another customs procedure allowed in respect of such goodswithin the established period) and part 2 of Article 429 (Within 30 days uponrevocation of a permit to open and operate a customs warehouse, the goodsstored in such warehouse shall be moved under customs supervision by theirholder or person authorized by them, or the customs ware housekeeper toanother customs warehouse, warehouse of the customs authorities or placedunder another customs procedure).\n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\nAfine amounting to 20 NTMI;

The legal proceedings include the following:\n-                     preparing a protocol on the violation of customs regulations;\n-                      interviews with the persons who are brought to administrative liability for customs offenses, with the witnesses and other persons;\n-                     requesting the documents that are required for the legal proceedings and in the customs offense case;\n-                     expropriating the goods, vehicles and documents;\n-                     performing a customs inspection;\n-                     submitting the goods, vehicles and documents for recognition and commission an expert investigation;\n-                     commissioning of expert evidence.\nIn accordance with Article 488 of the Code, the customs offense case shall be considered instituted from the moment of preparing the protocol on the violation of customs regulations.\nA customs offense report may be drawn up by the officials defined in Article 490 of the Code, namely:   \n- officials who are authorized by their job descriptions to perform customs supervision, customs clearance and release of goods, means of transport for commercial use across the customs border of Ukraine and directly found a customs offense;\n- customs officials who are entitled by their job descriptions to do so;\n- other officials authorized by the head of the Customs Service or head of customs office.\nThe Code defines the grounds for initiation of a customs offense case:\n- direct detection of customs offense by the revenue and duties officials;\n- official written notification of customs offense received from other agencies and authorities (including customs);\n- official written notification of customs offense received from foreign customs and law enforcement agencies as well as from international organizations.\nThe authorized official who identified a case of the customs offense shall prepare a protocol on each such case. The protocol shall be drawn up in the state language in two copies, one copy to be served against receipt upon the person who is brought to liability.\nIn this case, it shall be obligatory to explain the rights provided by Article 498 of the Code (Rights and Obligations of the Persons Brought to Administrative Liability for Customs Offense and of the Stakeholders) to the person who is brought to liability and the possibility shall be notified to them of terminating the proceedings brought as a result of the customs offense by way of a compromise.\nThe protocol as well as the confiscated goods, vehicles and the documents specified in the protocol shall be handed over to the customs authority within whose territory the customs offense was identified.\nEvidence in a customs offense case shall constitute any actual data used to find out, in the legally established manner, whether: there is a customs offense, a person is guilty of committing it, and there are other circumstances that matter for proper resolution of the case. Such data shall be found out through:\n- customs offense report, records of proceedings, appendices thereto;\n- explanations given by the witnesses;\n- explanations given by the person held liable;\n- expert opinion;\n- other documents defined by the Code.\nThe customs offense proceedings is held by the official person who evaluate the evidence at his own discretion based on comprehensive, complete and objective examination of all the facts and circumstances of the case in their entirety.\n\n\nCustoms offense proceedings shall engage the following:\n-                     persons brought to administrative liability for customs offense;\n-                     representatives of the persons brought to administrative liability for customs offense and stakeholders (legal representatives, representatives acting under the power of attorney, mandate);\n-                     defenders, experts, witnesses, interpreters/translators and attesting witnesses.\nPersons brought to administrative liability for customs offense and stakeholders are listed in Article 499 of the Code.\nAn administrative arrest may also apply to the violators of customs regulations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\nThe administrative arrest is one of the administrative enforcement measures that is applied against the will and wish of the violator, meaning a temporary restriction on the freedom of movement and an obligatory stay in a particular location area.\n\n\n\nThis procedure is used to stop the violation of customs regulations, to establish the identity of the person who committed such acts as well as to draw up a protocol, if it should prove impossible to draw up such a protocol at the place of committing the violation.\nThe term of administrative arrest is calculated from the moment the person is delivered to the official premises of the customs authority or to other premises where it is possible to perform the required actions.\nThe customs authority that effected the temporary detention of the person shall promptly notify the fact to the relatives of the detained person. If the detained person is a non-resident and does not have relatives in the territory of Ukraine, the diplomatic representative office or the consular institution of the relevant foreign state shall be notified.\nIf the acts of the person who committed the customs offense do not have the characteristics of a criminal offense, the legal proceedings against the violator of customs regulations may be stopped by way of a compromise. The compromise shall be the entry into an amicable agreement between the said person and the customs authority.\nThe agreement shall be considered invalid and the legal proceedings in the customs offense case shall be resumed, if the person who committed the violation of customs regulations did not perform the specified acts within the term provided in the amicable agreement (the term not to exceed 30 days). An amicable agreement in the case for violation of customs regulations shall not be challenged.\nWhere proceedings in a case for violation of customs regulations are discontinued by way of a compromise, the person who committed this violation shall be considered as not having been subject to administrative liability in this case.\nThe Code provides a clear delineation of responsibilities applicable to customs offense cases, meaning that there are Articles to be considered by customs authorities and those to be considered by district, district in the city, city or city district courts (judges). All cases for violation of customs regulations committed by the persons under the age of 18 shall be considered by courts.\nThe case for violation of customs regulations shall be considered at the location of the customs authority, which officers conducted proceedings in the case. The case shall be considered within a 15-day term from the day the customs officer or the court (judge) receives the materials required to render a judgment in the case.\nThe customs authority or the court (judge) considering the customs offense case may issue one of the following rulings:\n- on additional verification;\n- on the imposition of administrative penalties;\n- on the termination of proceedings.\nThe ruling on additional examination shall indicate specific subjects, objectives and terms of examination. These actions shall neither violate the rights of a citizen nor harm the economic activity of a legal entity.\nIt should be noted that if a court ruling is rescinded and the case is closed or if the administrative penalty should be changed, the confiscated goods, vehicles, the amount of the penalty or its relevant portion shall be returned to the person or their representative. In the cases where it is impossible to return the confiscated goods and vehicles in kind, their value shall be returned, less the amounts of the proper customs payments at the rates that were in effect as of the day of confiscation.\nThe terms of imposing administrative penalties in cases for violations of customs regulations\nWhere customs authorities or courts (judges) consider cases for violation of customs regulations, the administrative penalty for the violation of customs regulations may be imposed not later than 6 months after the day the offense was identified. The term of imposing administrative penalties in cases for violations of customs regulations shall be stopped for the period the court is considering such cases.\nWhere the criminal proceedings have been closed but the offender’s actions have the characteristics of a violation of customs regulations, the administrative penalties for the violation of customs regulations may be imposed not later than 3 months after approving the decision on closing the criminal proceedings. However, the administrative penalties may not be imposed later than 2 years after the day of committing the violation.\nThe customs decision in the customs offense case may be challenged before the State Customs Service of Ukraine or before a local court of general jurisdiction acting as an administrative court in accordance with the established procedure.\nThe grounds for rescinding the ruling on imposition of administrative penalties or on termination of proceedings in the case for violation of customs regulations shall include, in particular, the following: the acts of the person who is held liable do not have the characteristics of a violation of customs regulations; proceedings in the case are not objective or are incomplete or consideration of the case is not objective; the conclusions that are set forth in the ruling do not correspond to the actual circumstances in the case. However, the other circumstances provided by laws may be recognized as grounds for rescinding or changing the ruling on the imposition of administrative penalties.\nEnforcement of the ruling on the imposition of administrative penalties is a final stage in cases for violation of customs regulations that envisions the actual application of sanctions – a warning, a penalty and a confiscation. The procedures for and the order of the imposition of the penalties are set forth in the provisions of Chapter 73 of the Customs Code of Ukraine.\nIt is worth noting that decisions of customs authorities on the imposition of administrative penalties for violations of customs regulations shall be obligatory for enforcement. The rendered ruling of the customs authority shall be enforced after the term to challenge it ends.\nThe customs authority that rendered the ruling shall enforce it independently or through a state enforcement officer. If a ruling has not been submitted for enforcement during 3 months from the day of its rendering, the ruling shall not be enforced.\nA warning in the form of an administrative penalty shall be enforced by the customs authority and envisions the announcement of the ruling to the person that is subject to administrative liability and the serving of a copy of such ruling upon such person. If the person is not available, a copy of the ruling with an acknowledgment of receipt shall be sent within three days to this person.\nThe fine shall be payable by the person within 15 days form the date when a copy of the ruling issued, and, in case an appeal is filed - within 15 days from the date when the appeal (administrative action) is dismissed.\nThe fine shall be payable by the person to the state budget. Should the fine not be paid within the specified term, the ruling of the customs authority or the court (judge) shall be sent for enforcement to the state enforcement authority at the place of residence or employment of the offender, or at the location of the offender’s property.\nThe ruling of the court (judge) imposing administrative penalty for customs offense by way of confiscation shall be executed by a state enforcement officer in accordance with law.\nWhen it is impossible to confiscate goods or means of transport from the offenders by a state enforcement officer the cost of such goods or means of transport may be recovered upon a court order in accordance with the law.\nRulings of the customs authorities imposing administrative penalties for customs offenses against persons residing or staying outside Ukraine shall be executed at the expense of property held by such persons and located in the territory of Ukraine. Should the mentioned persons not hold any property in the territory of Ukraine, the procedure for execution of rulings of the customs authorities imposing administrative penalties for customs offenses shall be determined by the legislation of Ukraine and the relevant international treaties.\nViolations in the field of export control in the Criminal Code.\n \nThe Law of Ukraine \"On State Control of International Transfers of Military and Dual-Use Goods” of 02/20/2003 No. 549-IV (the “Law”) shall be the main normative act of Ukraine that determines violations and penalties in the field of export control.\nThe Law sets forth the types of violations (Article 24) that are committed by legal entities exporting the controlled goods and the appropriate sanctions for the commission of these violations (Article 25). Aside from that, Article 27 of the Law provides liability for violating the requirements of legislation in the field of export control by individuals who are exporters.\n \n\n\t\n\nBusiness entities that are natural persons and that violatelegislation in the field of state export control shall be subject to administrative, criminal and civil liability provided by law (Article 27 of the Export Control Law).\n\n \nIn particular, unlawful acts by business entities that are natural persons involving the goods, which may be used in the creation of nuclear, chemical, bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons, that are committed in violation of the procedure for performing international transfers of goods subject to state export control, shall be determined to have the nature of the crime in accordance with Article 333 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (Violation of the Procedure for Performing International Transfers of Goods that are Subject to State Export Control).\nThe said violations may also take the form of the preparation for bringing the relevant goods out of Ukraine or of an attempt to bring the relevant goods out of Ukraine without the appropriate permit providing the right to export goods that are included in the List of Goods Which International Transfers are Subject to State Export Control (or performing such acts using a canceled permit that had been issued some time ago). It also concerns the goods that are not included in the Lists but that necessarily are the goods, which may be used in the creation of the weapons of mass destruction or means of their delivery or of conventional weapons.\nLiability for such violations is provided in the form of a penalty (from 2 to 5 thousand non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens or an up to 3 years’ imprisonment or an imprisonment for the same term and becoming ineligible to hold certain offices or engage in certain activities for a term of up to three years or without establishing a specific term.\nIn the event of a repeated commission the said acts or doing so in an organized group, the sanctions that are applied take the form of an up to 3 years’ imprisonment or an imprisonment for the same term and becoming ineligible to hold certain offices or engage in certain activities for a term of up to 3 years.\nThe Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine establishes the procedure for conducting such investigations and imposing liability. In accordance with Article 333 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, the investigation of crimes is included within the powers of the Security Service of Ukraine. The court shall impose liability for such offenses.\nLegislation also provides liability for the development, production, purchase, storage, sale and transportation of weapons of mass destruction (Article 440 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).\nThe objective aspect of crime is characterized by the acts related to the development, production, purchase, storage, sale and transportation of weapons of mass destruction (bacteriological/biological, toxin and chemical weapons) that are prohibited by the international agreements ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Liability for such acts is established in the form of imprisonment for a term from 3 to 10 years.\n\n\nSection 9. National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs\n \n9.1.   The essence of the National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs\nIn accordance with world practice, regulation of foreign economic activity requires customs control over the goods moving between countries.\nThe correct classification of goods is an important component of the customs regulation system, as it depends on the establishment of their value pursuant to objective criteria and, accordingly, the reasonable assessment and collection of customs payments.\nWhen declaring goods, they are subject to classification, i.e. the codes are determined for the goods in accordance with the classification groups specified in the Ukrainian Classifier of Goods of Foreign Economic Activities (hereinafter - UKTZED). \nUKTZED is compiled on the basis of the Harmonized System of Description and Coding of Goods and is approved by the Law on the Customs Tariff of Ukraine.\nDuring the customs clearance of goods, the customs authorities control the correctness of their classification according to the UKTZED pursuant to the procedure established by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.650 dated 30.05.2012 (hereinafter - Procedure 650). If a violation of the rules of commodity classification is detected during or after the customs clearance of goods, the customs body has the right to independently classify such goods. Decisions of the customs bodies regarding the commodity classification for the customs purposes are binding.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nProcedure № 650 — The working procedure of the customs payments department, the customs clearance unit of the customs authority and the customs post in resolving issues of classification of goods moving across the customs border of Ukraine, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 650dated May 30, 2012.\n\n \nIn order to establish reliable information about the goods and their correspondence to the description of UKTZED, the customs authorities may request from subjects of foreign economic activity and citizens the samples of goods and their technical and design documentation for examination. The procedure for the interaction of structural units and territorial bodies of the Customs Service of Ukraine with the Specialized Laboratory for Expertise and Research during analyses and expertise was approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No.1058 dated December 2, 2016.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nProcedure № 1058 — The procedure for the interaction of structural divisions and territorial bodies of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine with the Specialized Laboratory for Expertise and Research of the SFS during the conduct of research (analyses, expertise) is approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 1058 dated December 2, 2016.\n\n \nTo classify (code) the goods during customs clearance, the Customs Tariff of Ukraine is used. It is systematized in accordance with the UKTZED which is compiled on the basis of the Harmonized System of Description and Coding of Goods, and approved by the Law of Ukraine No. 674 -IX dated June 4, 2020 \"On the Customs Tariff of Ukraine\". The structure of the ten-character digital code designating the goods in the UKTZED includes the code of the group (first two characters), product entry (first four characters), product sub-entry (first six characters), product category (first eight characters), product subcategory (ten characters).\nThe coding (classification) of goods is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the UKTZED and is a technique that allows presenting the goods in the form of a group of signs (goods code) set by this classifier. In order to avoid incorrect classification, it is necessary to take into account that the UKTZED consists of three components:\n- basic rules of interpretation of UKTZED;\n- notes to the sections and groups of UKTZED (section, group, entry, sub-entry, category, subcategory);\n- textual description of the UKTZED groupings and their numerical designation.\nGoods in UKTZED are grouped on several information levels, starting with the levels with the most general description of the types of goods, and ending with the levels containing description of specific goods. The distribution of goods into groups is based on specific data. The distribution of goods into groups takes place on the basis of features that have practical significance, which is important for the purposes of foreign economic regulation (for example, the difference between brown and black horses is not important). UKTZED groups do not cross each other in terms of content, otherwise the classification of goods would be arbitrary and quite unreliable.\nUKTZED contains 21 chapters (numbered with Roman numerals and not displayed in the product code) and 97 groups (numbered with Arabic numerals). Group 77 is not used.\nUKTZED has the following levels of detail:\n1. Sections are numbered with Roman numerals, which are not indicated in the commodity code. Contain notes that have legal force when classifying goods (the first basic rule of interpretation). At the level of sections, goods are grouped in accordance with the branches of industry by a combination of various goods characteristics:\n- origin (sections I, II, V);\n- functional purpose (sections IV, XI, XII, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI);\n- chemical composition (sections III, VI, VII);\n- the material from which the product is made (sections VIII, IX, X, XIII, XIV, XV).\n2. Groups - have a two-digit numbering in Arabic numerals, which has no connection with the numbering of sections. The first two characters of the product code correspond to the number of the group in which this product is classified. Contain notes that have legal force when classifying goods (the first basic rule of interpretation).\nThe 77th group is reserved and does not contain a textual description. At the level of groups, goods are detailed depending on the material from which they are made; from the functions they perform; from the degree of processing.\nSome groups contain an additional level of classification - subgroups, which are numbered with Roman numerals and which are not reflected in the structure of the digital code. For example, group 39 consists of two subgroups: I. \"Primary forms\" (entries 3901 - 3914) and II. \"Waste, trimmings and scrap; semi-finished products; articles\" (entries 3915 – 3926).\nWhen forming groups in UKTZED, the principle of the sequence of product processing is used - from raw materials to obtaining semi-finished products and finished products (raw materials - semi-finished products - finished products). For example, live cows are classified in commodity entry 0102, their meat is in commodity entry 0201, and ready-made food products made from this meat are in commodity entries 1601 - 1602.\n3. Entries - have a four-digit numbering, in which the first two characters correspond to the number of the group that includes this product entry. The textual description of product entries has legal force for the classification of goods (the first rule of the basic interpretation rules). Product detailing at the level of entries has more diverse and specific features than at the level of groups.\n4. Sub- entries are the lowest level of detailing of goods, at which the product code and its text description correspond to the UKTZED. They have a six-digit numbering, in which the first four characters correspond to the product entry into which this sub-entry is included. Additional details of the goods are used here, supplementing the above.\n5. Categories - have an eight-digit numbering, in which the first six characters correspond to the number of the sub-entry that includes this category. The detailing of goods corresponds to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union.\n6. Subcategories – contain a description of the product and its ten-digit product code.\nIn UKTZED there are cases when the textual description of the entry, sub-entry, category and sub-category coincides. That is, the product position is not detailed. For example,\n0503 00 00 00 - \"Horse hair and its waste ...\".\nIn the UKTZED, a special punctuation system (comma - \",\", semicolon - \";\" and colon - \":\") is of particular importance, which is used in the text description of the UKTZED product groups (entries, sub-entries, categories and subcategories).\nA comma between two parts of the text description of the UKTZED group indicates that any product that is indicated before the comma can be made of any material.\nA semicolon marks the demarcation of goods with different features (characteristics) that are combined in one commodity entry or sub-entry. That is, any definitions in the text description of the product group of UKTZED after the semicolon cannot be applied to the goods specified before the semicolon. It should be remembered that a new description of another product begins after a semicolon.\nA colon means the continuation of the detailing of the product group at another level.\nOne of the important features of UKTZED is the presence of the so-called \"hyphen system\". The hyphen system provides for specifying a certain number of dashes (hyphens) before the text names of detailed groups of UKTZED (sub-entries, categories, subcategories). The number of hyphens corresponds to the level of grouping. The different number of inserted hyphens shows the depth of detail and facilitates the search for the appropriate text name of the product according to a certain algorithm - from a smaller number of dashes (hyphens) to a larger number. In some groups of UKTZED (entries and sub-entries) there are additional levels of detail for which no numerical code is provided. They are marked with symbols \" - \" or \" - - \" placed before the text description. Without taking into account the specified text description, if it is available, the product cannot be classified. For example, above the sub-entry 0408 11 with the textual description \"- - dried\" there is a textual description \"- egg yolks\", in front of which there is no numerical code. Accordingly, the textual description of sub-entry 0408 11 should be read as \"egg yolks, dried\".\nAs a rule, at the level of groupings (entries, sub- entries, categories and sub-categories), one or more types of goods (products) that are the most traded in the world trade are allocated in the UKTZED, for other types of goods a generalized grouping with a text description \"others\" is assigned \"basket\" grouping. Due to the \"basket\" groupings, which have the textual description \"- other\", all products are included in the product nomenclature without exception.\nSome goods can be classified according to the material which they are made of, others - depending on the function that these goods are intended for. It is clear that the provision in which there is freedom of choice between material and function is not compatible with the requirements of UKTZED. Therefore, the UKTZED contains clear definitions and rules (basic rules of interpretation, notes to sections and groups), which regulate cases of partial coincidence of entries of UKTZED groupings or the impossibility of choosing the appropriate UKTZED group. This makes it possible to avoid partial overlaps, provided that the item (product) is designed to perform several functions or is made of several materials.\nNotes to sections and groups of the product nomenclature regulate conflicting situations not only between material and function, when it is necessary to assess which one is superior - the material the product is made of or its functional purpose, but also cases of different degrees of processing of goods. Thus, notes to sections and groups make it possible to divide different commodity items and to determine their priorities when classifying certain types of goods. Certain notes exclude specific goods from specific sections, groups and item entries. For example, note 1(a) to group 02 says that this group does not include products that cannot be used for human consumption, of the type specified in entries 0201 - 0208 or 0210. I.e., if a hog carcass (subheading 0203 11 ), for some reason is not suitable for use as human food (the meat spoiled during storage, or a sick animal was slaughtered), then in this case this carcass cannot be classified in group 02, but must be classified in group 05 (commercial code 0511 99 80 00). Definitions of terms are given in the notes. The terms are used to simplify the textual description of groups. It is necessary to keep in mind that the meaning and interpretation of certain words and terms in the UKTZED do not necessarily correspond to their generally accepted meaning and interpretation. For example, the meaning of the term \"tractor\" (note 2 to group 87) also includes road tractors and other vehicles designed to tow trailers. The meaning of this term applies only to group 87. However, the UKTZED contains terms that apply to several groups or to the entire UKTZED. Based on this, it is not always enough to read the notes to certain sections and groups. It is also necessary to read notes to other sections and groups that relate to similar types of goods, the materials they are made of, and the functions they perform. In some cases, notes determine the features of classification of certain goods, for example:\n- goods presented in sets (note 3 to section VI);\n- goods made of several materials (note 5 to section XV);\n- mixtures of different products (note 1 to group 9);\n- parts of goods (note 3 to group 94);\n- tools (note 3 to group 95).\n \n9.2.   Rules for determining commodity codes\nBasic rules of UKTZED interpretation are an integral part of UKTZED. These Rules serve as a comprehensive guide for assigning goods to a certain classification group. There are six such rules. The first four regulate the procedure for determining the commodity entry (the first four characters of the code), determine the procedure for assigning the product to a certain commodity entry. The sixth rule is applied after the product entry is defined, and regulates the assignment of the product to the appropriate sub- entry, categories and sub-categories. The first four rules are applied exclusively sequentially, going from Rule 1 to Rule 2(a), from Rule 2(a) to Rule 2(b), and so on. Rule 3(a) cannot be applied without applying Rules 1, 2(a), 2(b) in sequence. Only in the case of the impossibility of applying the previous rule when classifying goods, the following one is allowed. The sixth rule can be applied if it is necessary to define a group within the framework of a defined commodity entry. The fifth rule concerns the classification of packaging, cases, containers, etc.\nBasic rules of UKTZED interpretation:\n1. The names of sections, groups and subgroups are given only for the ease of use of\nUKTZED; for legal purposes, the classification of goods in UKTZED is carried out on the basis of the names of commodity entries and the corresponding notes to sections or groups and, unless these names provide otherwise, in accordance with the following rules:\n2. (a) any reference in the entry title to any commodity shall also include incomplete or unfinished commodity, provided that it has the essential characteristic of a finished item. This rule also applies to a finished product (or one classified as finished under this rule), unassembled or disassembled;\n(b) any reference in the entry title to any material or substance shall also include mixtures or compounds of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to a product made of a particular material or substance shall be construed as a reference to a product consisting in whole or in part of that material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance is carried out in accordance with the requirements of rule 3.\n3. In case if according to rule 2 (b) or for any other reasons, the goods prima facie can be attributed to two or more commodity entries, their classification is carried out as follows:\n(a) preference is given to the entry in which the goods are described more specifically over the entries describing them more generally. However, in the event when each of the two or more entries relates only to a part of the materials or substances included in the composition of a mixture or multi-component product, or only to a part of the goods put up for sale in a set for retail trade, such entries are considered equivalent in relation to that product, even if one of them provides a more complete or accurate description of this product;\n(b) mixtures, multi-component goods consisting of different materials or manufactured from different components, goods put up for sale in sets for retail trade, which cannot be classified under rule 3 (a), shall be classified by that material or a component that determines the main properties of these goods, provided that this criterion can be applied;\n(c) goods which cannot be classified under rule 3 (a) or 3 (b), must be classified by the entry with the highest serial number among the entry numbers under consideration.\n4. Goods that cannot be classified according to the above rules are classified by the entry that corresponds to the goods that are most similar to those in question.\n5. In addition to the above, the following rules apply to the goods specified below:\n(a) Cases for cameras, musical instruments, weapons, drawing instruments, ornaments and similar articles, specially shaped and designed to hold the relevant article or combination of articles, suitable for long-term use with the articles for which they are intended, are to be classified together with products packed in them. This rule does not apply to containers (packaging), which together with the product form a whole and give the latter significantly different properties;\n(b) according to rule 5 (a), a container, together with the goods contained in it, shall be classified with those goods if it is a type of container or package that is normally used for packing those goods. This provision is optional if this container (packaging) is suitable for reuse.\n6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in product sub-entries, product categories and product subcategories is carried out in accordance with the name of the latter, as well as the notes applying to them, taking into account certain reservations (mutatis mutandis), the provisions of the above rules, provided that only the names of the same detailing level can be compared. For the purposes of this rule, the relevant section and group notes may also apply, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThe Harmonized System Committee of the World Customs Organization has prepared explanations (in English and French) to the Harmonized System - \"EXPLANATORY NOTES\", which contain a comment on each commodity entry. These explanations contain comments on each commodity entry of the Harmonized System with a description of goods that are included or excluded from a specific commodity entry. Where possible, the content of the entry is explained along with the technical description of the goods in question (appearance, quality characteristics, methods of manufacture and use).\nAccording to the UKTZED requirements, the commodity classification (coding) is carried out as follows. At first, in accordance with the first rule of the Basic Rules of Interpretation of the UKTZED, the relevant commodity entry is determined (the first four characters of the commodity code) which describes the classified commodity. At the same time, it is necessary to check whether there is a corresponding note to the section or group that regulates the classification of this product. After defining the corresponding product entry, sequentially are determined the sub-entry, category and sub-category the text description of which corresponds to the product.\n9.3.   Preliminary decisions\nPreliminary decision on commodity classification in accordance with the UKTZED (hereinafter - PDCC) is issued by the customs authorities in relation to goods that are the object of a foreign economic agreement (contract) or another document used in international practice instead of an agreement (contract), including in relation to the Complete object (hereinafter - СO).\nThe PDCC is issued to the declarant or a person authorized by him and is valid for three years from the date of its issuance, if the facts and conditions on the basis of which this decision was made remain unchanged. PDCCs are issued before the beginning of the movement of goods across the customs border of Ukraine.\nAfter the expiry of the validity period, the PDCC becomes invalid, which does not prevent the declarant or a person authorized by him to apply for a new PDCC.\nIn order to obtain a PDCC, the declarant or a person authorized by him submits (sends) a written application to the customs authority for a preliminary decision on the classification and coding of the goods, including a СO (hereinafter - the application) for one item of the goods in the form established by the Order 650. The following shall be attached to the application of the declarant or a person authorized by him:\n- foreign economic agreement (contract) or other document used in international practice instead of an agreement (contract);\n- technical conditions, technological schemes of product manufacturing (if available);\n- photos, product drawings (if available);\n- permits and certificates of authorized state bodies (if available);\n- specifications, catalogs and passport data about the manufacturer's goods (if available);\n- certificates of product origin, permits, marking labels (if available);\n- product samples (if available).\n \nThe documents are submitted in the form of originals or their copies. If the original documents are written in a language other than Ukrainian or the official language of customs unions that Ukraine is a member of, the declarant or a person authorized by him shall ensure their translation into Ukrainian.\nIf there is confidential information about the goods (for example, in the name of the goods or in the composition of the goods), the declarant or a person authorized by him is obliged to inform in the application about the nature of such information.\nRegistration of the application takes place on the day of its actual receipt by the customs body in accordance with the established procedure in registration book of applications for PDCC.\nIf the application is submitted in the interests of the declarant or a person authorized by him, then a copy of the power of attorney drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation shall be attached to the application.\nThe period of issuing PDCC is 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the relevant application by the customs authority. This period may be extended by the head of the customs body or a person performing his duties, but not more than by 15 calendar days, with notifying the person who submitted the request in writing or electronically about the reasons, before the end of the 30-day period.\nIf the declarant or a person authorized by him fails to submit all necessary documents and information for PDCC, the deadline for issuing PDCC is counted from the date of submission by the declarant or his authorized person of all missing documents. At the same time, the declarant or a person authorized by him is given a written or electronic notification about the requirement to submit additional documents no later than 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the application.\nIf the declarant or a person authorized by him fails to provide the required documents or information, or if it is established that the application of this declarant or a person authorized by him has been examined by another customs authority regarding identical goods, the customs authority shall refuse to consider the application with justification of the reasons that became the basis for refusing to make the PDCC, with returning product samples (if they were submitted).\nRefusal to consider the application does not prevent the declarant or his authorized person from re-applying, provided that the reasons that were the basis for the refusal are eliminated.\nAn official of the customs payments department checks in the database of the Unified Automated Information System of the State Customs Service of Ukraine (hereinafter referred to as UAIS) the presence of PDCC or Decisions for identical or similar goods to the ones specified by the declarant or a person authorized by him in the application.\nThe availability of PDCC is checked with the help of the software complex \"Register of preliminary decisions on classification and coding of goods in UKTZED\" of UAIS (hereinafter - UAIS Register of PDCC).\nThe availability of Decisions is checked using the \"Classification Decisions\" database of the UAIS \"Inspector 2006\" program.\nIf the customs authority previously made a Decision regarding the goods that are the object of a foreign economic agreement (contract) or other document used in international practice instead of an agreement (contract), regarding the declarant (or a person authorized by him) and such Decision has not been changed or canceled , and if the facts and conditions on the basis of which the Decision was made remain unchanged, then the PDCC is not granted, except in cases where the granting of a PDCC is considered for the CO.\nDuring the next working day after the registration of the PDCC, its electronic copy, together with the available photos of the goods, is entered by an official of the customs payments department (CPD) into the UAIS Register of PDCC.\nInformation on PDCC made by customs authorities, with the exception of information that is confidential, is made public by the central executive body that ensures the implementation of state policy in the field of state customs affairs, in accordance with the requirements of Article 23 of the Customs Code of Ukraine.\nThe original PDCC is issued (sent) to the declarant or a person authorized by him, a copy remains in the customs authority that issued it.\nPDCC is used by all customs authorities during customs clearance.\nAbsence of PDCC is not a reason for refusal of customs clearance, except in cases where a CO is provided for customs clearance.\nThe original PDCC and its copy are submitted by the declarant or a person authorized by him to the customs authority simultaneously with the documents for customs clearance of the goods, the details of which are given in this PDCC.\nAfter verifying the PDCC copy with the original, the customs official returns the original to the declarant or to a person authorized by him. A copy of the PDCC remains with the customs authority.\nDuring customs clearance, the customs authorities carry out identification of the goods in order to establish the conformity of its characteristics with the information about the goods given in the PDCC.\nIn the case of establishing the fact of non-compliance of the goods with the information given in the PDCC, the customs authority that found the non-compliance, provides information about this fact to the customs authority that issued the PDCC. Afterwards, a decision is made regarding the customs clearance of the presented goods in accordance with Ukrainian legislation.\nThe customs body that issued the PDCC shall revoke it in accordance with the procedure specified in Article 23 of the Customs Code of Ukraine.\nIn the case of loss of the original PDCC, the customs authority that issued it shall issue a PDCC duplicate to the declarant or a person authorized by him upon a reasoned request.\nThe duplicate is issued within 10 days from the date of submission of the application on the basis of information kept in the files of the customs body that issued it. The duplicate of PDCC is filled in with the date and number of the original, in place of which it was issued. At the same time, the word \"DUPLICATE\" is written above the registration number.\nA note on the issuance of a PDCC duplicate is entered into the UAIS Register of PDCC during the next working day after the issuance of a duplicate PDCC. The validity period of a PDCC duplicate cannot exceed the validity period of the PDCC it is issued in lieu of. Only the customs authority that issued the original (or its successor) has the right to issue PDCC duplicates.\nThe PDCC is drawn up on the letterhead of the customs authority in the form established by Order 650, which also approved the Procedure for filling out the PDCC columns:\nColumn 1 indicates the full name of the customs authority that issued the PDCC.\nIn column 2, the PDCC registration number is indicated.\nThe PDCC registration number looks like this:\n\"PDCC - XXX - YYYY - ZZ\" (in the case when PDCC is issued for goods other than СO);\n\"PDCC - CO - XXX - YYYY - ZZ\" (in the case when PDCC is issued for the СO),\nwhere \"XXX\" is the first three digits of the code of the customs authority that accepted the PDCC;\n\"YYYY\" - serial number of PDCC;\n\"ZZ\" - the last two digits of the current year.\n \nIn column 3, the details of the declarant or a person authorized by him are indicated in the nominative case (full name/surname, first name, patronymic/, location/place of residence, EDRPOU code (Ukrainian state registry legal entity identifier) / registration number of the taxpayer's registration card or series and passport number (for natural persons who, due to their religious beliefs, refuse to accept the registration number of the taxpayer's registration card and have notified the relevant body of the state tax service about it and have a mark in their passport), contact phone number).\nColumn 4 indicates the date of issuance of the PDCC.\nIn column 5, the ten-digit product subcategory is indicated according to the UKTZED.\nColumn 6 indicates the full name of the product, its brand, model, grade, article number, modification, dimensions, packaging, completeness, manufacturer, country of origin.\nIn column 7, a detailed description of the product is indicated, including all information that is decisive for assigning this product to a ten-digit product subcategory of UKTZED, which is given in column 6. If necessary, references are given to the appendices to the PDCC, which contain images of the products, their parameters, individual characteristics, etc.\nIn column 8, the justification for issuing the PDCC is indicated (references to normative legal acts on commodity classification, Basic rules of interpretation of the UKTZED, relevant notes to sections and groups, explanations given to product entries of the UKTZED, etc.).\nIn column 9 of the original PDCC or its duplicate, the signature of the head (or deputy head) of the customs authority is affixed and the name and initials of the executor are indicated.\nIf the declarant or a person authorized by him provides samples of the product or its packaging (container), a photo of the product and/or its packaging is printed on the reverse side of the PDCC.\n\n\n Section 10. Control lists\n \nUkraine, as an equal and integral partner, is a participant in all currently existing international security regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Zanger Committee (ZC), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Australia Group (AG).\n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nINTERNATIONAL SECURITY – the state of international relations, which excludes the violation of peace or the creation of real threats to the security of nations in any form; activities of states and international institutions in maintaining such a state; a universal system of mechanisms, measures and guarantees, the totality of which excludes the use of force.\n\n \nWASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT (WA) is an export control regime designed to promote regional and international security and stability by increasing transparency and accountability in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thereby preventing destabilizing accumulations.\nThe NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP (NSG) is an association of nuclear supplier states that have agreed on common principles for the export of “nuclear sensitive” items and seek to prevent the acquisition of nuclear weapons by countries not designated as nuclear. The Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines and technical list cover industrial goods that can be used to build nuclear weapons.\nZANGER COMMITTEE (NC) is an informal organization of the participants of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), whose task is to determine the list of goods export of which in accordance with Article III.2 of the NPT must include the application of nuclear material safeguards, as well as conditions and procedures regulating its supply.\nThe MISSILE TECHNOLOGY CONTROL REGIME (MTCR) is an informal and voluntary association of countries united to prevent the proliferation of missile delivery systems that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (other than manned aircraft).\nTHE AUSTRALIA GROUP (AG) is an informal forum of states that by agreeing on export control rules seek to prevent trade from contributing to the development and proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Coordinating national export control measures helps countries participating in the Australia Group to fully implement their obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\nThe control lists are compiled, maintained and updated within all of the above regimes. Each of these lists is thematic with respect to its regime.\nLater, these lists became the basis for the creation of national control lists of goods international transfers of which are subject to state export control. In Ukraine, there are two control lists, namely: the Single List of Dual-Use Goods (hereinafter - SL DUG) and the List of Military Goods.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nTHESINGLE LIST OF DUAL-USE GOODS (Annex to the Procedure for the State Control over International Transfers of Dual-Use Goods, approved by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated January 28, 2004 No. 86)is a national Ukrainian control list of non-military goods, international transfers of which are subject to state export control of Ukraine.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nTHELIST OF MILITARY GOODS, INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO STATECONTROL (Annex to the Procedure for the State Control over International Transfers of Military Goods, approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of November 20, 2003 No.1807) is the Ukrainian national control list of military goods, international transfers of which are subjectto state export control of Ukraine.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n10.1. Structure of the control lists\nThe structure of the SL DUG of Ukraine is based on the relevant list of the European Union. It was developed taking into account all the previous experience of using “regime” lists and is as intuitive as possible, which makes it easy to use this list for all parties of the international transfers of goods, regardless of their level of knowledge in the field of export control.\nFrom a practical point of view, the SL DUG of Ukraine is a list of alphanumeric designations assigned to goods included in this list, taking into account the character of the product, its functionality and the control regime for this product.\nConventionally, the SL DUG of Ukraine can be divided into two parts, namely: i) the reference part, which includes sections providing general notes and giving an idea of ​​the terms and definitions found in the SL DUG, and ii) the commodity part, which consists of the goods descriptions that are subject to control and their alphanumeric designations.\nThe commodity part of the SL DUG of Ukraine includes 13 sections, which can also conditionally be divided into the main categories (10 of them in total) and additional sections (3 of them in total), namely:\nMain categories\nCategory 0 Nuclear materials, facilities and equipment\nCategory 1 Special materials and related equipment\nCategory 2 Materials processing\nCategory 3 Electronics\nCategory 4 Computers\nCategory 5 Part one. Telecommunications. Part two. Information security. Part three. Special technical means\nCategory 6 Sensors and lasers\nCategory 7 Navigation and avionics\nCategory 8 Marine\nCategory 9 Aerospace and propulsion\nAdditional sections\nSection “Sensitive” goods”;\nSection “Very sensitive” goods”;\nSection “Category I of goods that can be used in the creation of missile weapons.”\nEach of the main sections includes all goods of a specific subject international transfers of which are subject to state export control.\n \n\nExample\n\n\t\n\nCategory 9. “Aerospace and propulsion” of the SL DUG of Ukraine consists only of goods relevant to this topic, such as: various aviation and space vehicles, engines of various types that ensure their movement, separate units and components for them, and soon.\n\n Each of the ten main categories is divided into 5 product groups, namely:\n- A – Systems, Equipment and Components;\n- B – Test, Inspection and Production Equipment;\n- C – Materials;\n- D – Software;\n- E – Technology.\n \nRegarding the alphanumeric designation, the following should be noted.\nThe alphanumeric designation consists of at least five characters (which is the main part of the designation) and is a so-called “entry of the control list.” Determining the entry of the control list is one of the basic elements in the system of commodity identification in the field of export control.\nThe first character (numbers from 0 to 9) in the alphanumeric designation indicates belonging to one of the ten main categories of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\nThe second character (Latin letters A, B, C, D, E) in the alphanumeric designation indicates belonging to one of the five groups of one of the ten main categories of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\nThe third character (digit) in the alphanumeric designation indicates the affiliation to a specific international export control regime or the fact that international transfers of this product are controlled only in Ukraine. The international export control regimes and national control in Ukraine are coded with this third character (number) in the alphanumeric notation as follows:\n \n\n№ \n\n\t\n\nRegime control\n\n\t\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nWassenaar Arrangement (WA);\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\t\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR);\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG);\n\n\t\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nAustralia Group (AG);\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC);\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\t\n\nNational control (NC).\n\n\t\n\n9\n\n \nThe fourth and fifth characters (two-digit numbers from 01 to 99) in the alphanumeric designation mean the serial number of the controlled product.\n \n\nExample\n\n\t\n\nAlphanumeric designation:\n\n9A012 – “Unmanned aerial vehicles”(”UAVs”), unmanned “airships”, related equipment and components…\n\nWhereas:\n\n- 9 – category “Aerospace and propulsion”;\n\n- A – group of goods “Systems, equipment and components”;\n\n- 0 – control regime Wassenaar Arrangement;\n\n- 12 – two-digit number of a specific product.\n\n \nThe product can be simultaneously controlled by various international export control regimes. In such case, this product will be in the SL DUG of Ukraine under different headings, although the last two characters (fourth and fifth) in such entries will match.\n \n\nExample \n\n\t\n\nInternational transfers of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are controlled under both the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Missile Technology Control Regime. Therefore, UAVs are simultaneously controlled under the following entries in the SL DUG of Ukraine:\n\n- 9A012 – “Unmanned aerial vehicles”(“UAVs”), unmanned “airships”, related equipment and components…; and\n\n- 9A112 – “Unmanned aerial vehicles” (“UAVs”), other than those specified in 9A012…\n\nThat is, the third character of the alphanumeric designation indicates that the product is simultaneously controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Missile Technology Control Regime, respectively, and the sameness of the two-digit numbers of each of the specified alphanumeric designations indicates that in both cases the product is of the same type(UAVs), which, nevertheless, may differ in technical characteristics.\n\nUsually, the description of the product, attached to the main part of the alphanumeric designation, is supplemented with additional information that clarifies the technical characteristics of the product. Such additional information is introduced into the SL DUG of Ukraine according to the principle of alternating letter and number designations, which are added to the main part of the alphanumeric designation of the product after a dot. The main additional information is provided in the subsection to the relevant entry of the SL DUG of Ukraine, and this subsection is designated with a letter. Further, even more detailed clarification of the main additional information receives a numerical designation. An even more detailed specification will again receive a letter designation.\n \n\nExample \n\n\t\n\nEntry of the SL DUG of Ukraine 1C010.e.1.b,where:\n\n- 1C010 – the main part of the alphanumeric designation of commodity that corresponds to the entryv1C010 of the SL DUG of Ukraine – “Fibrous or filamentary materials”;\n\n- e – sub-entry that corresponds to the entry 1C010.e of the SL DUG of Ukraine - fully or partially resin-impregnated or pitch-impregnated “fibrous or filamentary materials” (prepregs), metal or carbon-coated “fibrous or filamentary materials” (preforms) or ‘carbon fibrepreforms,’ having all of the following ...;\n\n- 1 – sub-entry that corresponds to the entry 1C010.e.1 of the SL DUG of Ukraine– having any of the following:…;\n\n- b – sub-entry that corresponds to the entry 1C010.e.1.b of the SL DUG of Ukraine– organic or carbon “fibrous or filamentary materials”, having all of the following: …\n\nIt should be noted that the first ten (main) categories of the SL DUG of Ukraine define all goods international transfers of which are controlled. However, among these goods there are those that cause concern more than others in terms of non-proliferation, security and counter-terrorism issues. Additional measures may be introduced for such goods, such as:\n- special accountability to relevant export control regimes; and\n- a complete ban on international transfers.\nIn order to emphasize the exceptional importance and facilitate the search, such goods were highlighted in separate (additional) sections of the SL DUG of Ukraine, namely:\n- Section “Sensitive” goods”;\n- Section “Very sensitive” goods”;\n- Section “Category I of goods that can be used in the creation of missile weapons.”\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nThe item can be equally in all additional sections.\n\nIf an item listed in the main categories of the SL DUG of Ukraine needs to be entered into additional sections, its alphanumeric designation is copied from the main category, while the description and technical characteristics may differ.\nThe structure of SL DUG of Ukraine also includes such an important element as notes. SL DUG of Ukraine has several types of notes, namely:\n- General notes;\n- Notes;\n- Special notes; and\n- Technical notes.\nGeneral notes are given at the beginning of the SL DUG of Ukraine and provide general explanations both for individual sections and for the entire list as a whole.\n \n\nExample \n\n\t\n\nGeneral notes\n\n- The term “dual-use goods” in this List is used in the sense given in Article 1 of the Law of Ukraine “On the State Control over International Transfers of Military and Dual-Use Goods”.\n\nGeneral “Information Security” Note (GISN)\n\n- “Information security” items or functions should be considered against the provisions in Category 5 – Part 2,even if they are components, “software” or functions of other items.\n\nSpecial notes are found (i) in the general notes, (ii) in the part of the SL DUG of Ukraine called “Definition of terms used in this List” (more details about this section is below) and (iii) in the sections of the SL DUG of Ukraine. They provide additional explanations and point out that a product with a similar name, description and/or technical characteristics can also be found under another entry of both the SL DUG of Ukraine and the List of military goods.\n \n\n\n\nExample\n\n \n\n\t\n\n- Special Note to the General“Information Security” Note (GISN)\n\n \n\n  Clause“a” of the general note on software does not exempt from control the“software” specified in the second part of section 5 of this List(”Information Security”).\n\n- Special Note to the term«Focal plane array» of the part of the SL DUG of Ukraine called «Definitionof terms used in this List».\n\n  This term does not include a set of individual sensitive elements or any two-,three- or four-element detectors, provided that time delay and integration are not performed within the elements.\n\n \n\n- Special note to entry 1B234.\n\n  See also the List of military goods.\n\nTechnical notes are given in the part of the SL DUG of Ukraine called “Definition of terms used in this List” and in sections of the SL DUG of Ukraine. They provide a detailed technical explanation of a specific entry.\n\nExample \n\n\t\n\n- The technical note to the term “Chemical Means of Stopping Mass Disturbances” of the Section entitled“Definitions of Terms Used in used in this List”.\n\n  Teargases are a subgroup of the “means of stopping mass disturbances.”\n\n- The technical note to entry0A001.i.\n\n  Steam generators specifically intended or prepared for the transfer of heat produced within the generator towards feed water to produce steam. In the case of the reactors on fast neutrons that also have an intermediate loop of the heat transfer agent, it is the steam generator located on the intermediate loop. In a reactor with a gas cooling system, the heat exchanger may be used to transfer heat to the secondary gas loop driving the gas turbine.\n\nNotes are listed in the part entitled “Definitions of Terms Used in the List” of the SL DUG of Ukraine as well as in the Sections of the SL DUG of Ukraine. The notes provide some specifying interpretations of the entries that have an unclear or insufficiently conclusive information. The notes also show that there are exceptions where the goods under the relevant entry are not subject to Ukraine’s export control.\n\nExample \n\n\t\n\n- The note to the term“Operation, Administration or Servicing” in the Section entitled “Definitions of Terms Used in used in this List”.\n\n  ”Operation, Administration or Servicing” does not include any of the tasks listed below or any of the key management functions related thereto:\n\na)                 preparation or updating of any cryptographic functionality that is not directly related to the creation of the authentication data or to the management of such data to support the performance of the tasks listed above in subparagraphs 1 or 2 of paragraph“a”; or\n\nb)                 ensuring of any crypto graphic functionality concerning the data switching plane or article data plane.\n\n- Note to entry 5A001.d.\n\n  In accordance with entry 5A001.d, the following shall not be controlled: “phased antenna arrays with electronic control of the direction pattern” that are used in the landing systems equipped with instruments meeting the requirements to microwave landing systems (MLS) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nNotes, technical notes and special notes may apply to the list entry, a subparagraph and to another note.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nEven at this level, the intuitive nature of the SL DUG of Ukraine manifests itself – the note applies to the structural element that matches the indents it has from the left edge of the sheet.\n\nEqually important is the part of the SL DUG of Ukraine called “Definition of terms used in this List.” Export control is an extremely specific field with a deep emphasis on authentic terminology, where the definition of the term is the line between the issues of the presence or absence of grounds for the application of export control procedures, the possibility or impossibility of international transfer of controlled goods, and even a conviction or acquittal in criminal proceedings based on the fact of legislation violation in the field of state export control.\n \n\n\t\n\nMore detailed information is in section 10.2 of this Handbook. \n\nBeing part of the structure of the SL DUG of Ukraine, the terms are conditionally divided into general terms and vector terms.\nThe general terms set forth in the Section entitled “Definitions of Terms Used in the List” of the SL DUG of Ukraine are marked with the quotation marks and denote the general framework terminology that applies to all the entries on the SL DUG of Ukraine, provided the entry does not have a note with a vector term.\nThe vector terms differ from the general terms in that they (i) are marked not only with the quotation marks but also are written in italics, (ii) specify the definition set forth by the general term, given the requirements of a specific entry, and (iii) appear only in the notes to the entries.\n \n\nExample \n\n\t\n\n- General term.\n\n  “Fibrous or filamentary materials” [Fibrous or filamentary materials] (Sections 0, 1, 8, 9) include the following:\n\na) continuous “monofilaments”; \n\nb) continuous “yarn” and“foreyarn”;\n\nc) “ribbons,” fabrics, fiber mats and volumetric weaves;\n\nd) fine-cut fibers, staple fibers and connected (coherent) fiber layers;\n\ne) mono- or polycrystalline thread-like crystals of any given length; \n\nf) fiber mass of aromatic polyamide.\n\n \n\n- A vector term in the note to entry1C210.\n\nNote\n\n  Under entry 1C210, the term “fibrous orfilamentary materials” is limited to continuous monofibers, “yarn”, “woven roving”, “fiber bundles” or “ribbons”.\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nThe above vector note has a reference to general notes and such notes are not written in italics.\n\nThe presence of abbreviations and acronyms used in the SL DUG of Ukraine should also be noted. A clear understanding of the difference between these concepts and knowledge of the information provided in this list allows to significantly reduce the time of searching for goods in the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nAbbreviations and acronyms are listed in English in alphabetical order. \n\n \n \n10.2. Search for products in the control lists\nThe search for goods in control lists can be defined as the process of identifying specific commodities in the field of export control.\nCommodity identification in the field of export control should be understood as the procedure of finding goods intended for international transfers in control lists.\nIn practice, commodity identification in the field of export control is carried out by export control specialists.\nStable, high-quality performance of this kind of task is possible only with (i) the presence of deep technical knowledge, (ii) understanding of the structure of the control lists and (iii) the ability not to lose concentration for a long time (an error due to the human factor can harm both the country’s reputation in the international arena and its national interests).\nDespite the fact that the search for goods in the control lists is a rather complicated process, nevertheless, it has a clear and logical algorithm of actions, the implementation of which, taking into account the above, guarantees a quality result.\nThe algorithm of actions during the search for goods in the control lists can be conventionally divided into the following stages:\n- stage 1. Determining whether the product belongs to the relevant category of the SL DUG of Ukraine (0 - 9);\n- stage 2. Determining whether the goods belong to the corresponding group of goods (A – E);\n- stage 3. Determining whether the product belongs to the appropriate control regime (0-9) and its two-digit number;\n- stage 4. Determining whether the goods belong to the sections “Sensitive” goods,” “Very sensitive” goods” or “Category I”;\n- stage 5. Determining the correspondence of the search results to the provided information and making a decision on further actions.\nLearn more about each step of the search in the control lists.\nStage 1. Determining whether the product belongs to the relevant category of the SL DUG of Ukraine (0 - 9).\nThe best option would be to use the help of a technical specialist, but in the absence of thereof such conclusion should be made on the basis of a logical analysis of the available data about the commodity. A clue can be the name of the commodity, a description of its technical characteristics, areas of use, etc. Even an image of the commodity can help to find more information through the Internet search.\n \n\nExample\n\n \n\n\t\n\nRegarding the opticalsensors product, it is clear from the name that it belongs to Section 6of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n\nTechnical description of the product Software for modeling the project integration of missile launching vehicles indicates that this product belongs to Category 9 of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n\nA Google lens search allows to clearly understand that the product is a target-seeking head and belongs to Category 7 of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 2. Determining whether the goods belong to the corresponding group of goods (A – E)\nAs part of this stage of the search, the appropriate group of goods is determined according to the following principle:\nA – completed systems, subsystems and their components;\nB – machine tools with or without software for them and other similar products;\nC – materials from which goods of group A are made, or with the use of which goods of group A are produced on goods of group B;\nD – software used for goods of group A or goods of group B;\nE - technologies and services related to the above groups.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nEach of the product groups belongs exclusively to its category!That is, for example, the technology of category 0 cannot refer to goods ofany other category of the SL DUG of Ukraine, unless otherwise specified inthe note.\n\n\n\nStage 3. Determining whether the product belongs to the appropriate control regime (0-9) and its two-digit number.\nThe next stage of the search is the identification of the product in accordance with the specific entry of the SL DUG of Ukraine. By searching by keywords (provided you know how to pick them up) or by rereading all the entries of the relevant group of goods in the selected category, the match is determined between the description, technical characteristics and designation of the entry of the SL DUG of Ukraine with the product that is being identified.\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nDuring such a search, it is extremely important to remainfocused and pay attention to allentry notes, as well as general notes, if they are referenced.\n\n \n\nStage 4. Determining whether the goods belong to the sections “Sensitive” goods”, “Very sensitive” goods” or “Category I.”\nThe main mistake is stopping the search for goods in the SL DUG of Ukraine at the third stage, when a match has been found and the conformity of the goods to a specific entry has been determined. As already mentioned, stricter control measures are applied to goods that correspond to the sections “Sensitive” goods”, “Very sensitive” goods” and “Category I”, which can significantly complicate or make it impossible for exporters to transfer goods internationally. Unscrupulous exporters may attempt to circumvent these restrictions and prohibitions by, for example, providing false product information. Therefore, the stage of such verification is no less important than all others.\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nIn the sections “Sensitive” goods”, “Very sensitive” goods” and“Category I”, the description of technical characteristics can be eitheridentical to the corresponding entry in categories 0 - 9, or different. Inthe first case, it is noted that allgoods corresponding to an entry of categories 0 to 9 also correspond to aspecific entry in additional sections. In the second case, the entries inadditional sections correspond only to goods with the specified technical characteristics or those that exceed them.\n\n \n\nStage 5. Determining the correspondence of the search results to the provided information and making a decision on further actions.\nAccording to the results of the search for goods in the control lists, export control specialists make a decision on the necessity to prepare a package of documents for obtaining permits for the right to carry out international transfers of goods.\nThe above stated algorithm is illustrated with some examples below.\n \n \nExample 1.\nCommodity - thermoset resin impregnated continuous \"tow\" with a length of 0.68 m, made of continuous carbon \"monofilament\", which has a \"specific tensile strength\" of 25.5 x 104 m.\nGoal - to determine whether there are grounds for applying export control procedures.\n Step 1. \nThe description of the product contains the words \"thermoset\" and \"carbon\". They indicate that specialized materials are involved. Thus, the section of the SL DUG of Ukraine is identified - Category 1. Special Materials and Related Equipment.\nStep 2.\nAccording to the product description, it is a \"tow\". Thus, the commodity is a material. The group of goods is determined - Group C. Materials.\nStep 3.\nTaking into account that the commodity in question is not just any \"tow\", but specifically a thermoset resin impregnated continuous \"tow\", it is reasonable to choose the word \"thermoset\" as the keyword for search.\n \nSearch results:\n\n \n\n\t\n\nTechnical Note\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n“The 'glass transition temperature (Tg)' for1C008.a.2. thermosetting materials and 1C008.a.3. materials isdetermined using the 3-point bend method described in ASTM D 7028-07 orequivalent national standard. The test is to be performed using a dry testspecimen which has attained a minimum of 90% degree of cure as specified byASTM E 2160-04 or equivalent national standard, and was cured using thecombination of standard- and  post-cureprocesses that yield the highest Tg”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Note. \n\n“The 'Dynamic Mechanical Analysis glass transition temperature (DMA Tg )'for materials specified in 1C010.e. is determined using the method describedin ASTM D 7028-07, or equivalent national standard, on a dry test specimen.In the case of thermoset materials, degree of cure of a dry test specimenshall be a minimum of 90% as defined by ASTM E 2160-04 or equivalent nationalstandard”. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n1C210.c\n\n\t\n\nc)\n\n\t\n\nThermoset resin impregnated continuous \"yarns\", \"rovings\",\"tows\" or \"tapes\" with a width of 15 mm or\nless (prepregs), made from carbon or glass 'fibrous or filamentary materials'specified in 1C210.a. or .b. \n\n\n\t\t\t\nA search for a keyword yielded 4 results, only one of which was in the control list entry 1C210.c. Furthermore, for the sake of completeness, here are two search options: the mistaken and the correct one.\nMistaken:\nAs part of this option, we compare the description, purpose, and technical characteristics with the entry 1C210.c and find a match with the first part of the entry. Then we find entries 1C210.a and 1C210.b and determine that the technical specifications of the commodity are greater than those specified in entry 1C210.a.2.\n\n1C210.a.2\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2)\n\n\t\n\nA \"specific tensile strength\" of 23,5 x104 m or more; \n\nBased on the search results, we conclude that the commodity meets the description, purpose, and technical characteristics of entry 1C210.c of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\nThe final step is to check the availability of this entry in additional sections, where it is absent.\nThe final conclusion: the result of such a search is mistaken due to the omission of notes!\nHere is the correct search option:\nThere is a note before entry 1C210.c:\n\n \n\n\t\n\nNote.\n\nIn 1C210, 'fibrous or filamentary materials'is restricted to continuous \"monofilaments\",\"yarns\", \"rovings\", \"tows\" or\"tapes\" \n\nAccording to general notes to the SL DUG of Ukraine:\n «Fibrous or filamentary materials” (Categories 0, 1, 8, 9) include:\na) Continuous “monofilaments”;\nb) Continuous «yarns» and «rovings»;\nc) «Types», fabrics, random mats and braids;\nd) Chopped fibres, staple fibres and coherent fibre blankets;\ne) Whiskers, either monocrystalline or polycrystalline, of any length; \nf) Aromatic polyamide pulp.\n«Monofilament» (Category 1) or filament is the smallest increment of fibre, usually several micrometres in diameter.\nBased on the search results, we can conclude that, taking into account the general note to the SL DUG of Ukraine, the \"monofilament\" material used to produce the commodity cannot be classified as any of the materials listed in the note to entry 1C210.c. While the product matches the description and purpose, it does not meet the technical characteristics specified in entry 1C210.c of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nOnly when a commodity simultaneouslymeets the description, purpose, and technical characteristics specified inthe relevant entry of the SL DUG of Ukraine it can be concluded that theproduct corresponds to the chosen control list entry.\n\n \n \nExample 2 (abbreviated).\nCommodity - liquid propellant rocket engines with a vacuum thrust of 0.8 kN, modified for use on a satellite.\nGoal - determine the presence or absence of grounds for applying export control procedures.\nStep 1.\nThe words \"rocket engine\" - Category 9 Aerospace and propulsion.\nStep 2.\nThe engine is equipment - Group A.\nStep 3.\nA search for the keyword \"liquid\" indicates the following entries in Category 9 and Category I of the SL DUG of Ukraine.\n \nCategory 9:\n\n9A105\n\n\t\n\nLiquid propellant rocket engines or gel propellant rocket motors, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nSpecial note.           \n\nSee also entry 9А119.\n\n\n\n\n9A105.a\n\n\t\n\na)\n\n\t\n\nLiquid propellant rocket engines or gel propellantrocket motors, usable in \"missiles\", other than those\nspecified in 9A005, integrated, or designed or modified to be integrated,into a liquid propellant or gel\npropellant propulsion system which has a total impulse capacity equal to orgreater than 1,1 MNs;\n\n\n\n\n9A105.b\n\n\t\n\nb)\n\n\t\n\nLiquid propellant rocket engines or gel propellantrocket motors, usable in complete rocket systems or\nunmanned aerial vehicles, capable of a range of 300 km, other than thosespecified in 9A005 or 9A105.\na., integrated, or designed or modified to be integrated, into a liquidpropellant or gel propellant\npropulsion system which has a total impulse capacity equal to or greater than0,841 MNs.\n\nSection Category І:\n\n9A105.a\n\n\t\n\nLiquidpropellant rocket engines or gel propellant rocket motors, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\na) \n\n\t\n\nLiquid propellant rocket engines or gel propellantrocket motors, usable in \"missiles\", other than those\nspecified in 9A005, integrated, or designed or modified to be integrated,into a liquid propellant or gel\npropellant propulsion system which has a total impulse capacity equal to orgreater than 1,1 MNs.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nSpecial note.           \n\nSee also entry 9А119.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nConsidering the structure of the SL DUGof Ukraine, though the search did not give such a result, it is necessary tocheck also the corresponding entries of other controls of the regime. In thiscase, due to the difference in the description (Liquid propellant rocketengines (9A105) and Liquid rocket propulsion systems (9A005)), the searchfound only entry of the MTCR control regime.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\nThus, the following entries should be added to the search results:\n\n9A005\n\n\t\n\nLiquid rocket propulsion systems containing any of the systems or components,specified in 9A006. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nSpecial note.           \n\nSee also entries 9А105 and 9А119.           \n\n\n\n\n9A006\n\n\t\n\nSystems and components, specially designed forliquid rocket propulsion systems, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\nSpecial note.           \n\nSee also entries 9А106, 9А108 and 9А120.\n\na)      Cryogenicrefrigerators, flightweight dewars, cryogenic heat pipes or cryogenicsystems, specially designed\nfor use in space vehicles and capable of restricting cryogenic fluid lossesto less than 30% per year;\n\n\n\nb)      Cryogeniccontainers or closed-cycle refrigeration systems, capable of providingtemperatures of 100 K\n(-173°C) or less for \"aircraft\" capable of sustained flight atspeeds exceeding Mach 3, launch vehicles or\n\"spacecraft\";\n\n\n\nc)      Slushhydrogen storage or transfer systems;\n\n\n\nd)      Highpressure (exceeding 17,5 MPa) turbo pumps, pump components or theirassociated gas generator or\nexpander cycle turbine drive systems;\n\n\n\ne)      High-pressure(exceeding 10,6 MPa) thrust chambers and nozzles therefor;\n\n\n\nf)       Propellantstorage systems using the principle of capillary containment or positiveexpulsion (i.e., with\nflexible bladders);\n\n\n\ng)      Liquid propellantinjectors with individual orifices of 0,381 mm or smaller in diameter (anarea of 1,14 x\n10 -3 cm 2 or smaller for non-circular orifices) and specially designed forliquid rocket engines;\n\n\n\nh)      One-piececarbon-carbon thrust chambers or one-piece carbon-carbon exit cones, withdensities exceeding\n1,4 g/cm 3 and tensile strengths exceeding 48 MPa.\n\nFor this example, it should be considered that the technical characteristics of the commodity do not correspond to those specified in the entries of the WA regime.\nTherefore, according to the above information, if the notes are disregarded, the commodity, meeting the entries 9A105.a of the SL DUG of Ukraine, is a commodity of Category I of the MTCR, and, accordingly, severer restrictions and prohibitions should be applied to it.\nBut, as stated earlier, neglecting notes is a critical mistake.\nAccording to the note to entry 9A105.a of Section \"Category I\" of the SL DUG of Ukraine, \"Apogee liquid propellant rocket engines or positioning engines specified in entry 9A105.a, designed or modified for use on satellites, may be assigned to Category II of the MTCR while exported subject to end-use obligations on satellites and quantities corresponding to the declared end-use, and having a vacuum thrust of no more than 1 kN\".\nThat is, under certain conditions, such commodity can belong to Category II of the MTCR and it is possible to determine this only by taking into account the notes.\n \n10.3. How to use the correlation table\nThe term “correlation table” means the table of correspondence of the control list entries with the customs codes (commodity codes according to UKTZED – Ukrainian Classifier of Goods of Foreign Economic Activities).\nCurrently, there is no official document called “correlation table” in the Ukrainian export control regulatory and legal base.\nAt the same time, in practice, there is still a need to determine the control list entries depending on the customs codes according to the UKTZED. This necessity arises in two cases. The first arises during the commodity identification in the field of export control. The second - during customs control of goods.\nDuring the commodity identification in the field of export control, with the aim of facilitating (narrowing) the search for goods in control lists, it is possible to use special types of software that can be conditionally considered a “correlation table”, since they contain links between goods under the UKTZED and possible control list entries. Such specialized software products are, for example, QD Pro and MD Office.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nTo obtain information about the entry of the control list using the UKTZED code, it is enough to have access to the Internet, without the need to have any specialized licensed software product for customs clearance. The above-mentioned programs (QD Pro and MD Office) are available on the websites of software providers for brokers: QD Pro - at the link https:qdpro.com.ua/uk/goodinfo; MD Office - at the link https://www.mdoffice.com.ua/ru/aMDOGoodsInfo.html (registration required). These software products are just one of those tools that help determine the entry of the control list by narrowing the search field.\n\nDuring commodity identification these programs allow export control specialists to narrow down the list of analyzed entries by using UKTZED codes, but at the same time it is necessary to take into account the following important points:\n1. The information displayed on these resources (in the Export control section) is based on the control lists that were valid before the implementation of the SL DUG, while in many entries of the control lists there were no UKTZED codes, i.e. programs do not “pull” all potential entries from the list;\n2. The regulatory documents used for the analysis, indicate the codes from past (repealed, no longer in force) versions of UKTZED, which may not correspond to the currently valid code for a specific commodity.\nDuring the customs declaration procedure, in order to check goods for their presence in the control lists, customs officials also use special software products, which can be tentatively considered a “correlation table.”\n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nCustoms clearance by the customs authorities is carried out with the help of the computer software complex “Inspector-2006”, created by the specialists of the State Customs Service of Ukraine with the involvement of a professional software development company. Submitting customs declarations and carrying out other customs formalities are performed by declarants or persons authorized by them only in electronic form using software products capable of exchanging the necessary information with customs authorities in a format that technically and organizationally meets the requirements of theInspector-2006 software complex and customs legislation of Ukraine.\n\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nThe information provided in the “correlation table” is for reference only. Determining the entry of the control list to which a specific product intended for international transfer corresponds is the prerogative of the State Export Control Service of Ukraine. At the same time, only the customs authority has the right to make a final determination of customs codes according to UKTZED. In accordance with clause 1.6 of the Procedure for the use in customs authorities of permits and conclusions of the SSECU and their electronic copies (Approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 649 dated 30.05.2012), in the permit document of the SSECU, the product code according to UKTZED is indicated for reference.\n\n \nThe use of the QD Pro software is illustrated below with as an example of searching for the corresponding entry in the control lists by the UKTZED code.\n \n\nPay attention!\n\n\t\n\nUKTZED code is a complex, multi-layered structure, so correctly identifying the corresponding code for a specific product is crucial for proper commodity identification using this method.\n\n \nCommodity: Rocket nozzle.\nUKTZED code: 8412 90 20 90.\n \nStep 1.\nGo to the page using the link https:qdpro.com.ua/uk/goodinfo and see the following window, \nwhere we enter the UKTZED code for the rocket nozzle - 8412 90 20 90 - in the \"Enter the product code according to the UKTZED\" field and click the \"Find\" button.\n \nStep 2.\nIn the next window, there are three sections: \"Import\", \"Export\" and \"Transit\", in each of which a lot of useful information can be found, including information related to export control issues.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \"Import\" section, items 13 and 14 list all entries of the SL DUG of Ukraine and the List of Military Goods respectively (19 entries in item 13 and 1 entry in item 14), to which the goods may be pertain, and therefore there is a likelihood that the exporter needs to obtain a permit for the right to import such goods.\n\n\nIn the \"Export\" section, items 2 and 3 provide the same information, but, in accordance with the title of this section, there may be a need to obtain a permit for the export of goods.\nItems 2 and 3 of the \"Transit\" section, respectively, indicate the likelihood of applying export control procedures for the transit of goods through the territory of Ukraine.\nResult \nBy using this, in essence, \"correlation table,\" 19 entries of the SL DUG of Ukraine and 1 entry of the List of Military Goods were identified, all of which need to be checked for compliance of the description, purpose, and technical characteristics of the goods with the information provided in these entries.\n \n10.4. Use of open sources and special programs\n10.4.1. Control lists\n\n\nAs mentioned before, Ukraine is currently a member of all five international export control regimes.\n\n\t\n\nFor a complete list of countries operating in international export control regimes, see “List of member-states of international export control regimes” (Appendix to the “State export control procedure for conducting negotiations related to the conclusion of foreign economic agreements (contracts) on export of goods” (as amended by Resolution No. 482of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated May 17, 2021, approved by Resolution No. 500 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated June 6, 2012)\n\nIn accordance with the obligations assumed within the framework of the specified regimes and the control lists approved by these regimes, Ukraine ensures proper control over export of:\n• conventional weapons (military goods) and related dual-use goods (WA);\n• missile equipment and technologies (MTCR);\n• nuclear and special non-nuclear materials, equipment and installations for their production, as well as certain types of other materials, equipment, software and technologies that can be used to create nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices (NSG, ZC);\n• dual-use materials, equipment and technologies that can be used to create chemical and biological weapons (AG).\nUkraine, together with other member-states of the international export control regimes, takes part in the work of the relevant regimes on an ongoing basis regarding the introduction of changes and additions into the control lists of such regimes.\nSuch activity of the state within the regimes is carried out by reviewing the existing control lists and by relevantly updating them. Once the control lists are updated at the regime level, they are adjusted at the national level.\nThe necessity of constant (annual) changes and additions to such “regime” control lists arise due to the emergence of new technologies, the current security situation in the world and market trends.\nThus, by periodically introducing changes and additions into the national export control legislation in accordance with the changes and additions to the “regime” control lists, Ukraine maintains its national control lists up-to-date.\nAs part of Ukraine’s participation in the activities of international export control regimes, in the part that concerns goods that must be subject to control, the relevant state bodies involved in export control procedures and work related to the regimes, use various sources of information, including closed, which have a certain security grading.\nAt the same time, along with the use of closed information sources, open information sources are used, which include the official websites of international export control regimes, namely:\n-                     The Wassenaar Arrangement, https://www.wassenaar.org/;\n-                     The Missile Technology Control Regime, https://mtcr.info/;\n-                     The Nuclear Suppliers Group, https://nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/;\n-                     The Zangger Committee, http://zanggercommittee.org/;\n-                     The Australia Group, https://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/minisite/theaustraliagroupnet/site/en/controllists.html).\nThe above official regime websites contain the most up-to-date information on updated control lists of goods currently subject to export control procedures.\nThus, open sources of information, in particular the above-mentioned official websites of international export control regimes, in the context of procedures for updating control lists, can be used as a “standard” to which national legislation in the field of export controls must comply.\n \n10.4.2. Sanction policy\nCurrently, the restrictions that Ukraine must adhere to while implementing foreign economic activities by its subjects are quite large. They include the following:\n• obligations of Ukraine in connection with membership in the UN;\n• obligations of Ukraine as an OSCE member-state;\n• obligations of Ukraine within the framework of international export control regimes;\n• obligations of Ukraine within the framework of multilateral international agreements;\n• reservations that should be taken into account in the context of Ukraine’s course towards European integration;\n• reservations in the context of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the USA.\nSubjects of international transfers of goods in order to conduct successful foreign economic activities must have up-to-date information on the state’s sanctions policy and be familiar with export control issues. It is for this purpose that information on the above-mentioned restrictions is open and available on the official website of SSECU (https://www.dsecu.gov.ua/ua/derzavy-vstanovleno-sanktsii).\nThe Wisconsin Project (or the Wisconsin Program) is an example of one of such open sources.\nThe Wisconsin Program is a specialized database (text search server) that was developed in 1995 by the private non-profit American research organization “Project “Wisconsin” (Washington, DC). Its founder and executive director is a law professor at the University of Wisconsin, who received a grant and funding to create the organization and develop the database. The company was founded in 1986.\nThe company collects, researches, summarizes information in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and disseminates such information by publishing risk reports. The report publishes information about companies and individuals that may be related to the distribution of WMD, the company has information on about 5,000 such entities. But the database is not a “black list” of subjects, the information in it should be considered as a “red flag”, as such, which should cause concern to users. A certain product may be included in the “black list” of a specific country. But being on such a list does not always mean a violation of legislation in the field of export control, circumvention of sanctions or non-observance of embargoes by the subject, the reason may be money laundering, drug smuggling, etc. In addition, the report contains information on goods (about 800 items) that are subject to export control, their specification, an explanation of the reason for being subject to control, and methods of control. The information in the database comes from open public sources.\nUsers of the “Wisconsin” database are licensing specialists, representatives of customs authorities, border guards, investigators, representatives of the prosecutor’s office and persons who control and are responsible for the fulfillment of the international organizations requirements, such as the United Nations in the field of non-proliferation.\nThe “Wisconsin” database is used in about 30 countries around the world due to the support of the U.S. Department of State, in particular, several U.S. government agencies, Western Europe, almost all of Central and Eastern Europe, and quite a lot of users in Asia.\nThe search for the necessary information in the database can be done by company or person name. By entering such a search, you can get information about: the subject’s address; his contact information; other names used by the entity; presence in the “black list” or the “risk” list; information update dates; description of the subject’s activity; UN Security Council sanctions applied to the subject; offense; punishment; limitation; the list of countries that have restricted cooperation with the subject; list of penalties.\nSince 2011, Ukrainian government bodies have had access to the Risk Report database, which was also developed and supported by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. The task of Wisconsin Project is to prevent the proliferation of WMD and its delivery systems. The Risk Report database is an important source of open information (in English) on individuals/companies around the world suspected of supporting WMD proliferation. Multinational corporations and governments of about 35 countries use this database as a supporting tool in the analysis of transfers of controlled goods, the analysis of applications for obtaining permits for the export of controlled goods, and for the investigation of offenses in the field of export control. The database currently includes detailed information on more than 5,000 legal entities associated with the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and missile systems, a description of their activities and photographs of the goods they produce. The database also provides a description of the hundreds of goods that are subject to export control and the reasons why each of those goods is subject to control. The database also provides government officials with access to reference materials such as the full text of the provisions of multilateral export control regimes, several blacklists and warning lists of various countries, and the full text of the US Export Control Regulations.\nSummarizing the issue of the use of open sources of information during activities related to export control, it should be noted that today open sources of special information are an important and very useful tool for a wide range of experts involved in solving export control issues, and is also a safeguard against strategic goods falling into the hands of persons involved in WMD proliferation programs.\n \n \n Section 11. Case studies \n11.1. Practical examples of identification of dual-use goods\nAccording to subparagraph 71) of paragraph 2 of Article 544 of the Customs Code of Ukraine, one of the main tasks assigned to the customs authorities is the implementation of state export control within its powers, the scope of which is determined by the Customs Code and other laws of Ukraine.\nIn Ukraine, for the purposes of customs clearance the classification of goods is carried out in accordance with Ukrainian Classifier of Goods of Foreign Economic Activities (UKTZED), which is the commodity nomenclature of the Customs Tariff of Ukraine, approved by the Law of Ukraine \"On the Customs Tariff of Ukraine\" №674-IХ dated June 4, 2020, and also taking into account the Basic rules of UKTZED interpretation and commodity characteristics that are decisive for its classification.\n \n\n\t\n\nSee Section 9 of this Handbook for more details on Ukrainian classification of goods of foreign economic activity.\n\n \nHowever, for the purposes of state export control, classification only in accordance with UKTZED is not enough. This is confirmed by the fact that under the Procedure for the use in customs bodies of permits and conclusions of the State Service for Export Control of Ukraine and their electronic copies, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine №649 dated May 30, 2012, in the Authorization document of the SSECU the UKTZED code is provided for reference only. Therefore, it is important to carry out correct commodity identification in accordance with the control lists (lists of military and dual-use goods, approved by the Decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine № 1807 of November 20, 2003 and № 86 of January 28, 2004). The absence in the control lists of one or another UKTZED product code cannot affect the content of the control lists. Customs control and customs clearance of goods must be carried out taking into account the legal framework in the field of state export control, based on the correspondence of the description of features, technical characteristics or the scope of application of such goods in the control lists.\n \n\n  \n\n\t\n\nThe identification procedure and control lists are covered in Section 10 of this Handbook.\n\n \nBelow are practical examples of incorrect classification and identification, which creates prerequisites for harming the national interests of Ukraine in the field of state export control.\n\n\nCase study № 1. Thermal imaging camera\nWhen carrying out the customs clearance of thermal imaging cameras, some economic operators use the product code 9025 19 20 90 according to UKTZED, because the specified code was absent in the former lists of military and dual use goods, approved by the Decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine № 1807 of November 20, 2003 and № 86 of January 28, 2004, which may lead to non-compliance with the conditions of non-tariff regulation in terms of export control.\nPartially, this situation is caused by the fact that there is no separate entry \"thermal imaging camera\" in the UKTZED and in the control lists.\nTherefore, in order to avoid such problematic situations, the description, technical characteristics and purpose of the product, and not its name, should be decisive during the identification procedure. So, precisely by their description, technical characteristics and purpose, some \"thermal imaging cameras\" may correspond to entry ML15.d (\"imaging equipment or infrared or thermal imaging equipment, specially designed for military use\") of the \"List of military goods, international transfers of which are subject to state control\" (Appendix to the Procedure for the State Control over International Transfers of Military Goods, approved by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine № 1807 dated November 20, 2003).\nIn the Single List of dual-use goods, depending on the technical characteristics, \"thermal imaging cameras\" can be identified as special technical means, etc.\n \n \n\nExample\n\n \n\n\t\n\nDepending on the technical characteristics, \"thermal imaging camera\" may be both controlled in accordance with entry 6A003.b.4 of the Single List of Dual-Use Goods of Ukraine, and may not be subject to the state export control of Ukraine according to, for example, the notes to this entry.\n\nAn example of a \"thermal imaging camera\" that is not subject to the state export control is the FLIR C3-X Energy Audit Thermal Imager (128x96).According to note 3 to entry 6A003.b.4.b of the Single List of Dual-Use Goods of Ukraine, imaging cameras that have, for example, a maximum frame rate of 9Hz or less are not subject to control. The above-mentioned \"thermal imaging camera\", according to the specification, has an image frequency of 8.7 Hz.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nThermal imaging cameras in the form of digital cameras, which are intended for photographing, video recording, observing objects, in particular, in conditions of insufficient lighting, fog, smoke (in case of fires), and do not have devices for measuring values related to the characteristics of infrared radiation of objects, are classified under commodity entry 8525 of UKTZED. Such goods are not regarded in group 90 in accordance with the requirements of note 1 (h) to UKTZED group 90.\nAccording to the requirements of UKTZED and the Regulation of the European Commission on classification \"Commission regulation (EU)\" № 314/2011 dated March 30, 2011, infrared thermal imaging cameras that have the function of measuring temperature (determining the level of infrared radiation) and which graphically or digitally display images of different temperatures in color on the display are classified in the product category 9025 19 20 of UKTZED.\nSince these devices measure the level of infrared radiation and determine the temperature of the object, and not the amount of heat absorbed or released by a solid body, liquid or gas, they cannot be regarded under the UKTZED product entry 9027.\nUnequivocal classification of thermal imaging cameras according to UKTZED is possible on the basis of complete information about their functional purpose and technical characteristics, which are decisive for classification.\nIn addition, according to the notes to the control lists, UKTZED product codes are given for reference. Under the legislation of Ukraine, the main prerequisite for making a decision on identification is the conformity of the goods declared for customs clearance with the name and description of the corresponding goods given in the control lists.\n\n\nCase study № 2. Ricin\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will review Ricin (UKTZED code 3002 90 90 00, white odorless powder, well soluble in water); the chemical name - ricin.\nCastor oil is widely used in civil industry. But at the same time, castor bean seeds are very poisonous (active substances - toxalbumin, ricin, ricinin). Currently, there are various studies on the use of ricin in the treatment of some types of lymphoma; in this case, it affects tumor tissues specifically due to which healthy cells are not damaged.\nAnd despite the fairly wide use of ricin and the availability of castor oil in any pharmacy, according to entry 1C351.d.4, Ricin belongs to the category \"Pathogens and \"toxins\", dangerous to humans and animals.\"\n\n\nCase study № 3. Sapphires\n\n\n\n\nAlso worthy of attention is the case of an attempt to export artificial sapphire with impurities. Foreign economic operator as part of the execution of the foreign economic contract was to supply the \"Products of optical monocrystalline sapphire with Ti coloring admixture - optical elements, preforms of various shapes and sizes\". The declaration for the goods was submitted with the following wording: The preforms are polished from artificial optical single-crystal sapphire with a coloring admixture, the optical quality of the material is Grade.... It is used in scientific equipment and pertains to the general industrial purpose. The UKTZED code is 9001 90 90 00, not listed in any list.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nThe information (including description of UKTZED codes) in this case study is presented in accordance with the state of affairs at the time of the incident and does not fully correspond to its current state\n\n \n\nAt the same time, before filling the declaration, the foreign economic operator received the conclusion of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stating that according to the results of the study, the products from artificial monocrystalline optical corundum (sapphire) (AI2O3) optically processed: elements, preforms, plates, rods, tubes, substrates with or without a tinting additive of titanium oxide (AI2O3:Ti), refer to code 9001 90 90 00 (optical fibers and optical fiber bundles, other optical fiber cables, sheets and plates of polarizing material: lenses, prisms, mirrors and other optical elements of any materials, unframed, except for such elements of optically untreated glass, others). Based on this conclusion, presented as an expert evaluation in the field of state export control, the foreign economic operator tried to prove that the goods are not subject to export control due to the discrepancy between the UKTZED code (9001 90 90 00) provided by the Chamber of Commerce and the UKTZED code given in the corresponding entry of the control lists (7103 10 00 00).\nFurthermore, it should be noted that:\n- the purpose of addressing of the foreign economic operator to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry was to \"determine the product code in accordance with the Ukrainian classification of goods of foreign economic activity (UKTZED)\";\n- in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine, the Chamber of Commerce, to which the foreign economic operator addressed, does not have the authority to carry out an examination in the field of state export control of Ukraine.\nHaving processed the specified declaration, the customs office received an independent expert opinion on the commodity identification, according to which the specified product corresponded to entry 6.C.5.a of the Single control list of dual-use goods Ukraine (Appendix 1 to the Procedure for State Control over International Transfers of Dual-Use Goods, approved by Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 86 of 28.01.2004) \"Synthetic crystalline \"laser\" host material in unfinished form of: titanium doped sapphire\", which can be used in the creation of conventional types of weapons, military or special equipment.\nDue to the fact that the items that were planned to be exported, according to their characteristics, can be used for the \"development\", \"production\" or \"use\" of dual-use goods, their international transfers are subject to the state export control of Ukraine. Therefore, in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine, this product cannot be exported without the corresponding permit document of the State Service for Export Control of Ukraine.\n \n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nThe words in \"quotes\" are given in the meaning according to the \"Definition of terms used in the Single control list of dual-use goods Ukraine\".\n\n \n\n \nThus, the timely and professional actions of the customs authority became the main factor in preventing this offense in the field of the state export control.\n \n Case study № 4. Aluminum products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today's world, it is impossible to do without aluminum. Alloys based on this metal are so widely used in a wide variety of industries that they have become truly irreplaceable. This metal is extensively used in aviation, automotive, electrical engineering, instrument making, construction and other industries. Aluminum is an important strategic raw material.\nThe importance of this material is emphasized in the UKTZED - a special group 76 \"Aluminum and products from it\" is allocated.\nGiven the wide use of aluminum and alloys of this metal, there is a need to distinguish goods that can be freely transported onto the territory of other countries from those whose transfer is limited and controlled. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to pay attention to certain characteristics that allow classifying the goods as controlled, for example:\n- \"material with a high strength-to-density ratio\" (aluminum alloys capable of having a tensile strength of 0.46 GPa or more);\n- specially prepared compounds or powders for the manufacture of gas diffusion barriers resistant to corrosion by UF6 (for example, aluminum oxide), with a purity of 99.9% by weight or more, with a particle size of less than 10 μm, measured according to the B330 standard of the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), and with a high degree of uniformity in particle size;\n- aluminides (nickel aluminides containing a minimum of 15% by weight of aluminum, a maximum of 38% by weight of aluminum and at least one additional alloying element; titanium aluminides containing 10% or more by weight of aluminum and at least one additional alloying element);\n- aluminum alloys having any of the following characteristics: a tensile strength of 240 MPa or more at a temperature of 473 K (200 °C); or a tensile strength of 415 MPa or more at a temperature of 298 K (25 °C);\n- aluminum alloys (Al-Mg-X or Al-X-Mg, Al-Zn-X or Al-X-Zn, Al-Fe-X or Al-X-Fe);\n- discrete, multi-phase, polycrystalline fibers of aluminum oxide in the form of chopped fibers or mats, containing 3% by weight or more of silicon dioxide with a \" modulus-to-density rating \" of less than 10 x 106 m;\n- aluminum powder in the form of either spherical or spheroidal particles with a size of less than 200 μm and an aluminum content of 97% (by weight) or more, if at least 10% of the total weight consists of particles with a size of less than 63 μm according to the standard ISO 2591-1:1988 or its national equivalents;\n- aluminum alloys having both of the following characteristics: \"capable of having\" a tensile strength of 460 MPa or more at a temperature of 293 K (20 °C); and manufactured in the form of pipes or cylindrical solid forms (including forgings) with an external diameter exceeding 75 mm;\n- beryls (beryllium and aluminum silicate) in the form of emeralds or aquamarines;\n- triethylaluminum (TEA), trimethylaluminum (TMA) and other pyrophoric alkyl and aryl derivatives of lithium, sodium, magnesium, zinc and boron;\n- ceramic powders with the following composition: simple or complex oxides of zirconium and complex oxides of silicon or aluminum;\n- valves completely made of aluminum, aluminum alloy, nickel or nickel alloy containing more than 60% nickel by weight, or protected by a coating of such materials;\n- \"aluminum alloys\" refers to alloys with a tensile strength of 190 MPa or more, measured at a temperature of 293 K (20 °C).\nThis information can be specified in the accompanying documentation (technical specifications, quality certificates, certificates of analysis, certificates of conformity, etc.).\n \n\n\nCase study № 5. Batteries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost every civilized person today has a device that requires batteries to operate: a television remote control, a wall clock, a cell phone, or a camera. All these gadgets have become so common that no one tries to understand the essence of their batteries functioning, and meanwhile, more than two centuries have passed since the invention of the prototype of the modern battery.\nBatteries can be divided into primary, which are not designed to be charged by any other energy source, and secondary, which are designed to be charged by an external power source.\nPrimary elements and batteries can be made in different shapes and sizes. They are usually cylindrical or pill-shaped. In these elements, electricity is generated due to chemical reactions.\nThe primary element is mainly a vessel with an alkaline or non-alkaline electrolyte (for example, potassium or sodium hydroxide, ammonium chloride or a mixture of lithium chloride, ammonium chloride, zinc chloride and water), in which two electrodes are immersed. The anode, as a rule, is made of zinc, magnesium or lithium, and the cathode (depolarizing electrode) can be made of manganese dioxide (mixed with coal powder), mercury oxide or silver oxide. In lithium primary cells, the anode is lithium and the cathode is e.g. thionium chloride, sulfur dioxide, manganese dioxide or iron sulfide. Anhydrous electrolyte is used because of the solubility and reactivity of lithium in aqueous solutions. Alkaline or neutral are usually used in air-zinc primary cells electrolyte. Zinc is used as an anode, oxygen that diffuses into the element is used as a cathode. Each electrode is equipped with a terminal or other device for connection to the external circuit. The main feature of a primary cell is that it is difficult or poorly recharged.\nElements can be grouped in batteries either in series, or in parallel, or in series-parallel.\nElectric batteries (rechargeable batteries and secondary batteries) are characterized by the fact that the electrochemical action is reversible in order for the battery to be charged. They are used as storage of electricity and as its source when the need arises. Steady voltage is passed through the battery, which causes certain chemical changes (charge); when the battery terminals are subsequently connected to the external circuit, these chemical changes are reversed and cause steady voltage in the external circuit (discharge). This phenomena cycle - charge and discharge - can be repeated during the battery lifetime.\nAccumulators are mainly a tank filled with electrolyte, in which two electrodes with terminals for connection to the external circuit are immersed. In many cases, the tank can be divided into several parts, and each compartment (cell) is a battery in itself; these elements are usually connected in series to provide a higher voltage. Several elements connected in this way are called a battery. Also, several batteries can be combined in a larger case. Accumulators can consist of liquid or dry cells.\nThe following must be taken into account for the implementation of state export control over batteries: international transfers of batteries with an energy density of more than 550 W x h/kg (for primary elements) and more than 300 W x h/kg (for secondary elements) at 20 °C are subject to control.\n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nEnergy density (W x h/kg) is calculated by multiplying the rated voltage by the rated capacity in ampere-hours (A x h)and dividing the product by the mass in kilograms. If the nominal capacity is not specified, the energy density is calculated as the product of the square of the nominal voltage and the discharge duration in hours, divided by the product of the load resistance during discharge in ohms and the mass in kilograms.\n\n \nThermal batteries designed or modified for missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles with a range of more than 300 km are also subject to control.\n \n\nNote\n\n\t\n\nThermal batteries are disposable batteries in which a solid non-conductive inorganic salt is used as an electrolyte. These batteries contain pyrolytic materials that, when ignited, melt the electrolyte and activate the battery.\n\n \n \n \n \nPractical advice\nBelow are groups of goods that are very difficult to identify at first glance. It is necessary to analyze the technical characteristics very carefully, comparing them with those given in the control lists, and the scope of application in order to determine the belonging to these or other control lists.\nThe following list contains goods that, depending on the technical characteristics, can be used to create nuclear weapons:\n\n\n\n\nThe following goods can be used to create chemical or biological weapons:\n\n\n\n\n11.2. Explanations for customs front-line officers about the initial identification of dual-use goods\nIn accordance with Article 12 of the Law of Ukraine № 549-IV dated February 20, 2003 \"On the State Control over International Transfers of Military and Dual-Use Goods\", initial identification of goods, as well as the implementation of necessary measures related to obtaining permits for the international transfers of such goods is the responsibility of the business entity.\nThe customs authorities, in turn, verify the correctness of the declared information, including compliance with export control requirements. At the same time, the main emphasis should be placed on the conformity of the description of features, technical characteristics or the scope of application of the goods to the entries specified in the Lists.\nThe state control over the listed goods applies to both new and used goods.\nIn some cases, for the convenience of identification of chemical compounds or their mixtures, the name of the chemical compound and its registration number of the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS number) are indicated in the Control Lists. Chemical compounds that have the same structural formula (including hydrates) are subject to control regardless of name and CAS number. CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of chemical compounds listed in the control lists have different CAS numbers, so as the mixtures which they are a part of.\nInternational transfers of \"services and works\" related to the \"development\", \"production\", \"use\", assembly, testing, \"modification\" and modernization of products, equipment, materials, \"software\" and \"technology\", listed in the Control Lists, are subject to control to the same extent.\nAll available sources of information regarding the goods and subjects of international transfer should be used for commodity identification: technical documentation and images/photos (drawings, passports, descriptions), information posted on the Internet, etc.\nThere is no universal algorithm for the correct identification of all goods, but there are a few points that should arouse suspicion and become the basis for a more detailed check of the declared information:\n- availability of information regarding the sender or recipient as subjects of international transfer of controlled goods;\n- availability of gray/green wooden boxes used for transportation (such containers are typical for military goods);\n- inconsistency of the appearance of the product or its marking with the data specified in the technical, other accompanying documentation or generally known information;\n- availability of references to military standards (MIL) in the accompanying documents;\n- the presence in the accompanying documents of codes/ciphers, which correspond to the entry of the goods in the Control Lists by the format (for example, 9A012);\n- the presence of a danger sign of classes 1 (\"Explosive\"), 6 (\"Poisonous and infectious substances\"), 7 (\"Radioactive substances\")\n- the product has a known military application (for example, unmanned aerial vehicles);\n- the product does not correspond to the economic activity of the exporter/importer;\n- payment for the goods is made by a third party who is not the recipient;\n- the package specified in the accompanying documentation (for example, packing sheets/information) is not typical for the declared goods;\n- product labeling indicates other senders/recipients than declared;\n- the transport route/mode of transport is economically unreasonable or illogical.\nAll these questions cannot clearly indicate the pertinence of the goods to the control lists, however, the presence of the above-mentioned factors, especially several in combination, should be the subject of detailed and meticulous consideration in terms of the implementation of restrictions in the field of the state export control of Ukraine.\n \n\n\n ANNEXES\nAnnex 1 National peculiarities of the export control system of dual-use goods in Ukraine\n \nNATIONAL PECULIARITIES OF THE EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM OF DUAL-USE GOODS IN UKRAINE\n \nUkraine is a member of the UN and OSCE and is a party to all the fundamental international treaties and conventions, in particular: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the Agreement Between Ukraine and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Aside from that, Ukraine is also a participant in all the international export control regimes.\nLaw of Ukraine No. 549 “On Government Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose and Dual-Use Goods” is a legal basis for implementing the provisions of the guidelines of international export control regimes into national legislation.\nThe hierarchy of export control legislation may be represented as a structure that has six conditional levels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1991, the Law of Ukraine No. 959-XII “On Foreign Economic Activity” was passed that established a legal framework for the government in the field of regulating certain types of sensitive goods. Article 20 of this Law provides that the export and import of weapons, ammunition, military equipment and special components for their production, of explosive and nuclear materials (including the materials in the form of heat transfer assemblies), technologies, machinery, plants, special non-nuclear materials and related services, sources of ionizing radiation as well as other types of products, technologies and services that are presently used in the creation of weapons and military equipment or are a state secret of Ukraine as provided by laws of Ukraine may be performed only by foreign economic activity entities that are exclusively authorized by Ukraine as a state.\n \nThe legal basis for the implementation of the guiding principles of international export control regimes into national legislation is the Law of Ukraine No. 549-IV “On Government Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose and Dual-Use Goods”. The Law provides that state export control is a set of measures to exercise control over international transfers of military-purpose and dual-use goods and their use by the legal entity or individual that is exercised by the specifically authorized executive body on state export control and other state authorities with a view to safeguarding national security interests and in accordance with Ukraine’s international commitments.\n \nThe resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (the “RCMU”) concerning the field of state export control include the following:\nResolution of the

In accordance with Decree of the President of Ukraine of 04/08/2011 No. 448 “On the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine” as revised and updated by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 03/31/2015 No. 159 “On Approving the Regulation on the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine” as revised and updated, the activities of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine are directed and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through First Vice Prime Minister – Minister of Economic Development and Trade[27].\n\n\n[27]Decree of the President of Ukraine of 04/08/2011 No. 448 “On the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine”; Regulation on the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine, Article 1 https://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/448/2011; Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 03/31/2015 “On the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine,” “Regulation on the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine,” Article 1 https://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/159-2015-%D0%BF#n9.\n\n\n\n\nDecree of the President of Ukraine of 04/08/2011 No. 448 and Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 03/31/2015 No. 159 establish the following main tasks of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine: implementation of the government policy in the field of state export control over international transfers of military-purpose and dual-use goods and other goods which are not included in the lists of goods subject to state export control and to which state export control procedures may be applied in accordance with law as well as the introduction of proposals as to the formulation of the government policy in the field of state export control.\nThe State Service of Export Control of Ukraine shall control international transfers of goods that are subject to state export control based on the national control lists of military-purpose and dual-use goods, technologies and software, which international transfers require special authorizations in accordance with the Law of Ukraine of 02/20/2003 No. 549-IV \"On Government Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose and Dual-Use Goods.” The national control lists of goods of Ukraine are prepared based on the control lists of multilateral export control regimes, which contents are similar to the lists of the European Union, the USA and other countries.\nLists of goods which international transfers are subject to control are provided in annexes to Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 11/20/2003 No. 1807 “On Approving the Procedure for State Control over International Transfers of Military-Purpose Goods” (as revised and updated by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 08/09/2017) and Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 01/28/2004 No. 86 “On Approving the Procedure for State Control over International Transfers of Dual-Use Goods” (as revised and updated by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 01/11/2018 No. 1) respectively.\n \nThe Law of Ukraine also establishes the circumstances under which the Government of Ukraine is entitled to regulate international transfers of the goods that are not specified in the national control lists. These are the transfers of goods to the countries that are subject to resolutions of international multilateral organizations or the rules of national legislation imposing an embargo on the supply of such goods, imported goods, the goods that are subject to state export control and the goods which possible end use is related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or means of their delivery or the goods that have the military end use. Such international transfers of goods require an authorization issued by the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nThe Single List combines some of the separate lists of international export control regimes, eliminates duplication of the elements and organizes the other elements into a general unified structure of goods classification. All the elements included in the Single List of Dual-Use Goods are classified using a five-digit alphanumeric system. Each digit stands for a certain characteristic of the element, which ensures that the traders and personnel responsible for the exercise of export control understand the nature of the element.\n \nThe first digit determines the category of the controlled element:\n \nCategory 0. Nuclear plants, materials and equipment;\nCategory 1. Special materials and their related equipment;\nCategory 2. Processing of materials;\nCategory 3. Electronics;\nCategory 4. Computers;\nCategory 5. Communication and “Protection of Information”;\nCategory 6. Sensors and lasers;\nCategory 7. Navigation equipment and avionics;\nCategory 8. Maritime business;\nCategory 9. Aerospace industry and propulsion/power plants.\n \nThe second digit determines the subcategory of the element:\n \nA. Systems, equipment and components;\nB. Testing, control and production equipment;\nC. Materials;\nD. Software;\nE. Technology.\n \nThe third digit determines the international regime that is the origin of the controlled element:\n \n0 Wassenaar Arrangement\n1 Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR);\n2 Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG);\n3 Australia Group (AG);\n4 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC);\n5 Not used;\n6 Not used;\n7 Not used;\n8 Not used;\n9 Reserved for national control.\n \nThe fourth and fifth digits determine the specific element that is subject to control. Similar goods that are subject to control by different international regimes are assigned the same fourth and fifth digits.\nBesides, the Single List of Dual Use Goods sets forth “sensitive goods” and “very sensitive goods” that are similar to the relevant lists contained in the list of dual-use goods of the Wassenaar Arrangement.\n \nSteps to be taken by the business entity intending to perform international transfers of goods that are subject to state export control.\n \nThe main stages that the company completes as part of export control procedures are the following: \nStage one: registration with the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nThe registration of the business entity of Ukraine with the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine as an entity engaged in performing international transfers of goods is the first important stage of export control procedures. It is at the stage that the goods are classified and included in the category of goods subject to the application of state export control procedures. Following the results of such registration, the business entity is granted the status of a business entity engaged in performing international transfers of goods. This status is an obligatory precondition to being issued the relevant authorization documents of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine and performing international transfers of controlled goods.\nStage two: determination of procedures for export/import of the goods.\nNational export control legislation has different procedures for export/import of goods depending on the category of goods (military or dual-use) and the availability of prohibitions or restrictions on the export of goods to a specific state.\na) procedures that depend on the category of goods\nIf, following registration, the goods are included in the category:\n- that is not subject to state export control, their export/import is carried out without the application of authorization procedures of export control;\n- of dual-use goods, their export is carried out with the application of authorization procedures under the general pattern of export control, while in the case of imports such procedures are applied only to the categories of such goods determined by legislation;\n- of military-purpose goods or the goods that are physical storage media of secret information, their export/import is subject to the authorization procedures and the condition for performing such export/import is the obtaining by the entity of the special authority to perform such activity.\nb) procedures that depend on the availability of restrictions\nIf, following registration, the availability was identified of restrictions on the export of goods to a specific state, the contract on their export may be concluded only after the business entity obtains the relevant authorization document (conclusion) of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine entitling the business entity to conduct negotiations related to the entry into such a contract.\nc) procedures that depend on the type of authorization document\nIf the business entity performs international transfers of controlled goods only occasionally, it may do so under the general export control procedures through obtaining one-time authorization documents.\nIf the business entity intends to become a permanent participant in foreign economic operations in controlled goods, it is provided with the opportunity to perform a simplified export control procedure: it would be issued general and open-ended authorization documents. The possibility of being issued such documents is sort of a privilege and requires the business entity to perform an additional stage in the form of establishing its own internal compliance program (ICP), to perform its state registration with the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine and obtain the relevant registration certificate.\n \nStage three: establishment of the internal compliance program\nGenerally, business entity’s establishment of the internal compliance program is a recommendatory rule of law. However, given the specific nature of international transfers of controlled goods, the establishment of ICP is beneficial to the business entities intending to perform the relevant operations in such goods in the international market both from the point of view of security and economic benefit. \nHowever, the business entity that established ICP has advantages over other entities. In accordance with law, it is these business entities exactly that are entitled to obtain general and open-ended authorization documents as well as obtain the relevant authority to export/import military-purpose goods and the goods containing information that is a state secret. \nStage four: obtaining the authority to export/import certain categories of goods\nIn accordance with legislation of Ukraine, to export/import military-purpose goods and the goods containing information that is a state secret, business entities planning to perform such export/import shall, except in the cases provided by clause 4 of the “Regulation on Granting Business Entities the Authority to Export and Import Military Purpose Goods and the Goods Containing Information that is a State Secret” approved by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 06/08/1998, No. 838 obtain the relevant authority from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.\nStage five: conduct of negotiations on the export of goods \nIf the business entity intends to enter into foreign economic agreements (contracts) on the export of goods, which supplies to the relevant foreign country are subject to restrictions, such business entity, before entering into such contract, shall obtain the authorization document (conclusion) of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nStage six: taking into consideration export control requirements when entering into contracts\nAny foreign economic agreement (contract on international transfers of “sensitive” goods is crucial to the foreign economic activities of the business entity. The contract is also an important element within the export control system. However, in addition to contracts, this system also uses the following:\n·                    additional documents in the form of end user certificates, import certificates, delivery confirmation certificates and\n·                    a number of specific instruments in the form of an authorization system (with the possibility of refusals) and a system of inspections of using the goods for their intended purpose (both documentary that are based on reports and physical that are conducted by means of performing “physical” control in the territory of the end user).\nStage seven: obtaining guarantee document from the foreign business entity\nGuarantee documents are a specific and very important export control tool. Usually, such documents have the form of appropriate certificates (end user certificates, import certificates, delivery confirmation certificates etc.) and are an integral part of the business entity’s application for the authorization document.\nFollowing the expert examination, the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine obtains information about the possibility of deviation of the goods from their end use, it may instruct the business entity to provide written guarantees of the end user regarding the possibility of inspecting the use of the goods for their intended purpose in the territory of the end user.\nAnother condition for the issuance of the authorization document may be the provision of a delivery confirmation certificate of the goods verifying the fact that the goods were delivered to the end user. As such, the business entity is recommended to obtain end user’s written guarantees of the provision of such document.\nStage eight: obtaining the authorization documents\nIf the business entity performed all the necessary stages listed under the previous subparagraphs, it may apply to the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine for the relevant authorization documents. To do this, it has to submit an application in the established form to the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine together with the documents related thereto. The types of such documents and their number depend on the specific international transfer of goods and the type of the authorization document (one-time, general or open-ended).\nStage nine: performance of the international transfers of goods\nThe authorization documents of the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine that were issued to the business entity entitle it to perform the international transfers of goods that are specified in these documents.\nStage ten: control of the delivery of the goods to the end user\nIn accordance with export control legislation, control of the delivery of the goods to the end user may be performed by business entity’s obtaining reliable information about such delivery and submitting a report on this to the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine.\nThe document verifying the delivery of the goods shall be drawn up by the body of the country of destination of the goods authorized to issue such documents.\nStage eleven: control of end-use of the goods\nExport control legislation provides that in the case of exporting goods, the exporting company shall take measures to inspect the end use of the goods and provide information about this to the State Service of Export Control of Ukraine as well as help the state authorities of Ukraine in performing such inspections.\nStage twelve: reporting\nThe business entities that were

Georgia joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on March 7, 1994. It is an international treaty aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies, promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and achieving the goal of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament.\nAccording to the agreement:\nEach nuclear-weapon state party is under an obligation not to transfer, directly or indirectly, nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices, and to control, directly or indirectly such weapons and explosive devices; It also has a duty not to assist or encourage any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture, acquire or control nuclear weapons.\nNon-nuclear-weapon States Parties undertake not to acquire, directly or indirectly, nuclear weapons and explosive devices, and to control, directly or indirectly such weapons and explosive devices; Do not acquire or manufacture nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or acquire or receive any assistance in the production of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices.\nNon-nuclear-weapon states are committed to obtaining assurances from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that nuclear energy will only be used for peaceful purposes and not to develop nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\nStates parties undertake not to transfer primary or special fissile material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of fissile material to any non-nuclear-weapon state for peaceful purposes, unless International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards apply to these primary or special fissile materials.\nThe treaty recognizes the right of all states parties to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without any discrimination and to enable all states to cooperate in the use of peaceful nuclear energy;\nAll state parties involved undertake to negotiate in good faith on effective measures, which will help to end competition in the field of nuclear weapons and will contribute to nuclear disarmament, as well as general and complete disarmament.\nThe treaty states that a nuclear-weapon state is a state that created and detonated a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967. These countries are: USA, Russia, UK, France and China. Currently, 191 countries of the world have joined the treaty.\n \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (OPCW)[29]\n\n\n[29] https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical Weapons Convention. It is an arms control agreement that prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The Convention entered into force on April 29, 1997. 193 countries are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Since November 27, 1995, Georgia has been a party to the Convention on the prohibition of the creation, production, storage and use of chemical weapons and on the destruction of stockpiles.\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (hereinafter referred to as the Organization) carries out the implementation of the goals and provisions of the Convention, control over the countries' compliance with the requirements of the Convention, dialogue and consultations between states, and inspection of military industrial facilities of the member states. According to the Chemical Weapons Convention:\n1. Each state party to the convention has undertaken an obligation that will never, under any circumstances.\n- Develop, manufacture, purchase, stockpile or store chemical weapons, and transfer directly or indirectly chemical weapons to anyone;\n- Use chemical weapons;\n- Conduct military training in the use of chemical weapons;\n- Help or encourage anyone to participate in any activity prohibited by a State Party under this Convention;\n2. Each state party is under an obligation to destroy chemical weapons that it possesses or that are under its jurisdiction or control;\n3. Each state party is under an obligation to destroy chemical weapons that it has left behind on the territory of another member state;\n4. Each state party is under an obligation to destroy any chemical weapons production facility owned, possessed or owned or located anywhere under its jurisdiction or control;\n5. Each state party undertakes not to use chemical weapons in the conduct of hostilities.\n \nThe convention also provides:\n- Mutual assistance of countries and cooperation with the organization in the event of the use of chemical weapons;\n- Inspection of chemical plants by an organization where the creation of chemical weapons is possible;\n- International cooperation in the peaceful use of chemicals in relevant fields.\nThe chemicals listed in the annexes to the Convention that can be used for the manufacture of chemical weapons are divided into categories:\n \nAnnex 1- includes chemicals that were manufactured, assembled or used as chemical weapons and that pose high threats (for example, lewisite agents, mustard gas, ricin, saxitoxin and all nerve agents). States are prohibited from having more than 1 ton of these substances, and more than 100 grams of such a substance must be declared to the organization. These substances have a very limited range of use for peaceful purposes. For example, nitrogen mustard is used to treat certain forms of cancer.\n \nAnnex 2- includes chemicals that can be used as precursors for List 1 chemicals, posing significant risks to the implementation of the objectives and key principles of the convention. The production of these chemicals must be declared to the organization. Export of these chemicals to non-member countries is prohibited. For example, Thiodiglycol is typically not suitable for human consumption or for therapeutic use, but may be used for industrial or research purposes or as an ink solvent.\n \nAnnex 3- includes chemical substances that contain some dangerous threats. These chemicals are widely used in the chemical industry and can be produced in large quantities for commercial purposes if they are not prohibited by the Convention. Information on plants producing more than 30 tons of such chemicals is provided to the organization that has the right to inspect them. Export of these substances to non-member countries is restricted. Such substances are, for example, phosgene, which is used in the production of many organic compounds, and Triethanolamine, which is used in the production of detergents.\nSubstances included in the Annexes to the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are included in the national control lists of military and dual-use goods in Georgia and are subject to permits control during import, export and transit.\n \nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BTWC)[30]\n\n\n[30] https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/\nThe Biological Weapons Convention entered into force on March 26, 1975. Currently, the Convention has 183 member states and 4 signatory countries. It was ratified by the Parliament of Georgia by Resolution No. 132 of March 6, 1996, and on May 22, 1996, Georgia joined the Convention.\nThe convention effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxic weapons.\nEach State Party to this Convention undertakes:\n- Never, under any circumstances, handle, produce, accumulate, acquire or otherwise store:\n§ Microbiological or other biological agents or toxins, regardless of the method of their production, the type and quantity that does not have a preventive, protective or other peacekeeping purpose;\n§ Weapons, equipment or delivery systems designed to use and deliver such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\n-        To destroy or convert to peaceful purposes all agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and vehicles specified in Article 1 of the Convention, which it possesses or which are under its jurisdiction or control. All necessary precautions to protect the public and the environment must be taken in accordance with the provisions of this article;\n-        Not to transfer to any person who should directly or indirectly in any way help, force or incite any state or group of states or an international organization to produce or otherwise acquire any agents, toxins specified in Article 1 of the Convention, weapons, devices. or delivery vehicle.\n-        To take the necessary measures, in accordance with their constitutional procedures, to prohibit or prevent the processing, production, accumulation, acquisition or storage of agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and delivery systems specified in Article 1 of the Convention on the territory of such a state or any other place under its jurisdiction or control;\n-        Consult and cooperate with each other in resolving any issues that may arise in connection with the purpose of the Convention or in connection with the implementation of the provision. Consultation and cooperation on the implementation of this Article may also be carried out through the use of appropriate procedures within the United Nations and in accordance with its Statute;\n\n\nThe Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC)[31]\n[31] https://www.hcoc.at/?tab=what_is_hcoc&page=text_of_the_hcoc\nhttps://www.un.org/ru/documents/decl_conv/conventions/hague_code.shtml\nhttps://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/hague-code-conduct-against-ballistic-missile-proliferation-hcoc/\n\n\nThe Hague Code of Conduct was adopted on 25 November 2020 as a mechanism to prevent the proliferation of ballistic missiles. It is the only legally binding document governing ballistic missile proliferation control. Currently, 143 countries have signed the Hague Code of Conduct. The Hague Code of Conduct sets out the following general measures for state parties:\na) ratify, accede to or otherwise protect:\n- Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1967),\n- Convention on International Liability for Damage caused by Space Objects (1972) and\n- Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (1975);\nb) To contain and prevent the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of providing weapons of mass destruction on a global and regional scale through multilateral, bilateral and national efforts;\nc) Exercise the utmost restraint in the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction, including, where possible, reducing national stocks of such missiles in the interests of global and regional peace and security;\nd) Exercise the necessary vigilance when considering cooperation in the implementation of rocket and space programs in any other country in order to prevent complicity in the development \n\n\n(promotion) of delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, given that such programs can be used to conceal a ballistic missile program;\ne) Not to assist or facilitate the implementation of any type of ballistic missile program in countries that may develop or purchase weapons of mass destruction in violation of the norms and obligations of international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties.\n\n\nThe Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)[32]\nThe Arms Trade Agreement (ATT) was adopted by a resolution of the UN General Assembly on April 2, 2013 and entered into force on December 24, 2014. To date, the treaty has 113-member states and 31 signatory countries that have not yet ratified it. The Arms Trade Agreement in Georgia was ratified by Resolution N4696 of the Parliament of Georgia dated December 23, 2015 and entered into force on August 21, 2016.\nThe Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) obliges member states to control arms exports, not violate arms embargoes, and ensure that arms are not ultimately used for human rights violations and terrorism.\nThe aim of the agreement is to establish the highest possible common international standard for the international trade in conventional arms, eliminate illegal trade and remittances in order to maintain peace, security and stability and reduce human suffering.\nIn addition, the ATT recommends that states apply the provisions of the Agreement to the widest possible range of conventional weapons.\nFor the purposes of the Agreement, international trade includes export, import, transit, transshipment and brokerage services (translations).\nThe Arms Trade Treaty includes:\na. Battle tanks\nb. Combat armored vehicles\nc. Large caliber artillery systems;\nd. Fighter jets;\ne. Combat helicopters;\nf. Military ships;\ng. Rockets and missile launchers;\nh. Small and light weapons.\n \nATT obliges Member States to:\n- Create and use a national control system and a national control list, for the effective implementation of the provisions of this Treaty.\n- Establish and implement a national control system in order to regulate the export of ammunition and to apply the export control provisions specified in this treaty in the process of issuing a permit for the export of ammunition;\n-Establish and implement a national system for the control of parts and components of conventional weapons during their export in such a way as to exclude the possibility of weapons assembly and apply the export control provisions specified in this treaty when issuing an export permit for such items.\n\n\n[32] https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/att/\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, the member state does not allow the transfer of conventional weapons, ammunition, parts and components if:\n- Such a transfer violates the measures introduced by the UN Security Council in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN, in particular the state’s obligations with respect to the arms embargoes and international treaties relating to the transfer and illicit trafficking of weapons.\n- There is credible information that these weapons and ammunition will be used in acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and to commit acts that violate the Geneva Convention of 1949, as part of an attack on civilians and civilian objects or other war crimes.\n- If export is prohibited under this treaty, each exporting member state, prior to issuing a permit, shall assess whether conventional weapons intended for export contribute to or damage peace or security and/or are used for such activities that are considered a crime in accordance with international humanitarian law, international human rights law, conventions and protocols on terrorism, transnational and organized crime, etc.\n-In addition, the exporting state should take into account the risk of the possible use of conventional weapons, ammunition, parts and components for gender-based violence or violence against women and children.\nIn accordance with the treaty, each member state takes the necessary measures to regulate, where necessary and within its jurisdiction, the import, transit and transshipment of conventional weapons and brokerage services.\n \nAssociation Agreement on the one hand between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Union and their Member States and on the other hand Georgia\nOn 25 November 2013, Georgia signed one of the most important international agreements in its history - \"Association Agreement on the one hand between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Union and their Member States and on the other hand Georgia,\" (ratified by the Ordinance of Parliament of Georgia No 2495-RS of 18 July 2014), which restated its commitment \"to cooperate and contribute to the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems by means of the following actions:\n- Taking steps to sign, ratify, or accede to, as appropriate, and fully implement all other relevant international instruments; and\n- Establishing an effective system of national export controls, controlling the export as well as transit of WMD-related goods, including a WMD end-use control on dual-use technologies, and containing effective sanctions for breaches of export controls\" (Association Agreement, Section II, Article 10).\n \nUnited Nations Resolutions and Sanctions[33]\nUNSCR 1540\n\n\n[33] https://matsne.gov.ge/document/view/2496959?publication=0\n http://www.parliament.ge/ge/ajax/downloadFile/34754/AA_ENG\nhttps://www.un.org/en/sc/1540/faq.shtml\n\nhttps://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/sc1540/\n\n\nIn accordance with the UN Charter VII, the UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004, UNSCR 1540) has been adopted at the 4956th session on 28 April 2004. The resolution emphasized that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery pose a threat to international peace and security, and all countries of the world must be involved in the fight against this threat.\n \nUNSCR 1540 (2004) discusses the threats posed by non-state actors trying to develop, acquire, produce or transport nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and means of their delivery, and emphasizes that every state should refrain from assisting such organizations by any means to prevent their involvement in such activities.\nUNSCR 1540 (2004) states that each country must adopt and efficiently implement appropriate legislation that prohibits any non-state actors from acquiring, owning, developing, transporting or using nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and means of their delivery, particularly for terrorist activities. It also prohibits countries from trying to participate in any of the above actions as mediators, supporters or financiers.\nUNSCR 1540 calls on each country to take and use efficient measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and means of their transportation and related materials by introducing national control measures, and for this purpose:\na) Develop and implement necessary efficient measures for accounting and storing such materials used in the production, use or transportation;\nb) Develop and implement necessary efficient measures of physical protection;\nc) Develop and implement effective measures necessary for border control and law enforcement in accordance with national legislation and international law for identifying and suppressing illicit trafficking, as well as for identifying intermediaries and preventing them, including through international cooperation, if necessary;\nd) Establish, improve, revise and maintain necessary efficient control over such goods for export and cross-border movement at the national level, including laws and regulations governing export, transit, trans-shipment and re-export, as well as controls regarding the provision of services such as financing and transportation for export and cross-border movement, which will facilitate distribution as well as control over the end user; apply necessary measures of criminal and civil liability for the violation of the aforementioned laws and other regulations in the field of export controls. In addition, the resolution recognizes the practical relevance of the control lists for achieving its goals and urges all member states to develop such lists as soon as possible.\nThe Resolution calls on states to:\n-        Promote multilateral agreements, to which they are parties, in order to fully implement them and strengthen them if necessary for the purpose of preventing the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons;\n-        Adopt rules and regulations to enforce the obligations of the key multilateral non-proliferation agreements at the national level, where this has not already been done;\n-        Develop necessary methods for informing industrial and public circles about the duties defined by such legislation.\nIn addition, the Resolution defines the following terms:\nDelivery systems - missiles and other unmanned systems that can carry nuclear, chemical or biological weapons designed specifically for such application.\nNon-state actor- a natural or legal person who does not have legal authority from any state to carry out actions in accordance with the resolution.\nMaterials related to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their delivery systems - materials, equipment and technologies covered by relevant multilateral agreements and treaties or included in national control lists and can be used to design, build, manufacture and use nuclear, chemical and chemical weapons or biological weapons.\n \nUNSCR 2231 (2015) -Sanctions against Iran\nOn December 23, 2006, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1737, which prohibits the supply of nuclear and missile materials and technologies to Iran and requires all countries to freeze the financial statements of individuals and legal entities listed in the annex to the resolution. At the same time, it calls on Iran to suspend uranium enrichment and heavy water production.\nOn July 20, 2015, following the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) by Iran with the six leading countries and the High Representative of the European Union (Group E3 / EC + 3), the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2231 (2015), which defined this plan and significantly weakened the sanctions imposed by the previous resolution, but certain restrictions on the supply of materials and technologies for Iran's nuclear and missile programs were maintained. The fulfillment of restrictions is mandatory for all states, including Georgia.\nThe JCPOA, adopted by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the E3/EC+3 Group (China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, United Kingdom, United States and EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy), reflects a gradual approach and includes mutual commitment of the parties. The implementation of the JCPOA guarantees bringing the Iranian nuclear program to a peaceful course and, as a result, will lead to lifting sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council against Iran as well as multilateral and national sanctions.\nAccording to this plan, Iran will never try to develop or acquire any nuclear weapons, to upgrade existing facilities (to turn the Fordow nuclear fuel enrichment plant and the ARK heavy water research reactor into research facilities and produce medical radioisotopes and industrial equipment), and work closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and others. The E3/EC+3 countries are required to lift the sanctions related to finance, banking and insurance, oil, gas and petro chemistry, maritime, transport and other areas imposed on Iran because of its nuclear program. UNSCR 2231 (2015) supported this plan and determined the responsibilities of \"all states\" in annex B to the resolution on the implementation of the JCPOA.\nUN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015) endorsed the plan and set out in annex B to the resolution the commitment of “all states” to implement the JCPOA.[34]\nParagraph 2 of Annex B to Resolution 2231 (2015) defines the types of nuclear activities in which all States can participate, provided they obtain the prior consent of the Security Council for each specific operation;\nParagraph 2 of Annex B to Resolution 2231 (2015) defines the list and conditions of entities specified in information circulars INFCIRC 254/Rev.13/Part1[35] and INFCIRC/ 254 / Rev.10 /\n[34] https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list\nhttps://undocs.org/en/S/2015/546\n[35] https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/2231(2015)\n\n\nPart2[36], in case of compliance with which the supply, sale or transfer the items mentioned to Iran does not require the prior consent of the Security Council;\nResolution 2231 (2015) approved the creation of a special “procurement channel”[37] in accordance with the JCPOA, which would ensure the transfer of items, materials, equipment, goods and technology required for Iran's nuclear activates under the JCPOA.\nResolution 2231 (2015) calls on Iran not to participate in activities related to the development of WMD delivery systems (ballistic missile) for 8 years from the date of its adoption by the JCPOA or until the corresponding report by the International Atomic Energy Agency and establishes the obligations of countries to supply goods and technologies associated with the creation of such systems.\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of annex B to resolution 2231 (2015), all states may supply Iran by any means with the products and technologies listed in document S/2015/546[38], or other items, materials, goods and technologies that may be used to create delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction and provide Iran with any technical, professional and financial assistance and brokerage services, or grant Iran the right to conduct commercial activities on its territory with the prior approval of the Security Council.\nIn accordance with Paragraph 4 of UNSCR 2231 (2015), if prior consent is obtained from the Security Council, each state can participate in the following activities: Using its own ships or aircraft either from its territory or through its own citizens, directly or indirectly sell or transfer warships, missiles or missile systems, or any battle tanks, military vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, armored vehicles and artillery units (as set forth in the General Register of UN Regulations) for use in the interests of Iran or for Iran, including spare parts or technical and financial support and other services. This limitation applies for 5 years from the date of adoption of the JCPOA or until the submission of the corresponding report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nUNSCR 2231 (2015) (6 (c)) also imposes sanctions on individuals and legal entities involved in developing Iran's nuclear program or participating in developing nuclear weapons and means of their delivery, encouraging all countries to freeze their financial and economic assets to prevent the transfer of such resources in any way and take all measures to prevent the transit or entry of these persons to their territory[39].\nHowever, this “Black list” is variable, since, according to a resolution, the Security Council has the right to add or remove a person from the list.\nOn May 8, 2018, President Trump announced his withdrawal from the JCPOA as he had evidence that Iran was still developing nuclear weapons, thereby violating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and in November reinstated sanctions against Iran and countries trading with Iran.\nOn May 8, 2019, Iran announced that it would exceed the amount stipulated in the contract for the supply of low-enriched uranium (300 kg), and on July 7, 2019 announced that it would enrich uranium to above 3.67%.\n\n\n[36] https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/documents/infcircs/1978/infcirc254r13p1.pdf\n[37] https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/documents/infcircs/1978/infcirc254r10p2.pdf\n[38]https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/2231/nuclear-related-transfers-and-activities-procurement-channel\n[39] https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list\n\n\nThe fate of the nuclear deal with Iran is still unclear today. President Biden said the United States would return to an agreement if Iran adheres to its JCPOA commitments and wants to negotiate a broader agreement that includes Iran's missile program, in response to which Iranian leader Ebrahim Raisi has called for an agreement and is not going to discuss extended agreement.\nIn a speech to the UN Security Council in late June 2021, Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on the Biden administration to lift sanctions against Iran in accordance with resolution 2231 (2015) and return Iran to its obligations to the UN Security Council. He also that the JCPOA is the best guarantee that Iran's nuclear program will not go beyond the framework of a peaceful settlement.\nUN resolution S/RES/1718 and sanctions against North Korea[40]\nIn 2006, in response to North Korea's nuclear test, UN resolution S/RES/1718[41] introduced economic sanctions against North Korea for the first time.\nWith the adoption of Resolution S/RES/1718, the United Nations urged North Korea to stop nuclear testing and ordered all countries to take measures to prevent direct or indirect delivery of the following items, which could be carried out from their territory either through their own citizens or using their ships and aircraft:\n- Military equipment, large-caliber artillery systems, rockets and missile systems, related materials, including spare parts and other items pointed out by the Security Council 1718 Sanctions Committee;\n- Materials, goods, equipment and technologies listed in S/2006/814[42] (list of nuclear materials, equipment and technologies), S/2006/815[43] (list of materials, equipment, goods and technologies related to the ballistic missile program) and S/2006/816[44] (list of materials, goods, equipment and technologies related to chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction), or those items that can be used to create nuclear or other types of WMD and ballistic missiles;\n- luxury items;\nUNSCRS/RES/1718 prohibits North Korea from exporting the above-mentioned goods and buying these goods by any means. All countries are obliged to prevent the transfer of technologies associated with the creation of weapons of mass destruction and provision of any services, including those associated with such activities, and to freeze the monetary and other financial assets and economic resources of North Korea and its citizens.\nIn 2009, the Security Council adopted UNSCRS/RES/1874 (2009), which strengthened the arms embargo and called on all states to check their airports and ports, as well as open waters, air and sea transport carrying goods for North Korea, and to seize and destroy them, if this cargo if this cargo is possibly related to the North Korean nuclear program.\nIn January 2013, in response to the launch of the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite and the DPRK's third nuclear explosion, UN Security Council Resolutions 2087 (2013) and 2094 (2013) were adopted, which tightened the sanctions imposed by previous resolutions limiting remittances to the DPRK from international financial systems.\n\n\n[40] https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1718\n[41] https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1718%20(2006)\n[42] https://undocs.org/S/2006/814\n[43] https://undocs.org/S/2006/815\n[44] http://undocs.org/S/2006/816\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, in response to the fourth nuclear explosion, the Security Council adopted UNSCR 2270 (2016), which banned the export of gold, vanadium, titanium and rare metals from the DPRK to the UN member states, as well as the export of North Korean coal and iron, except when it is necessary for the adoption of livelihood for Korea. The export of copper, zinc, nickel and silver was prohibited in accordance with UNSCR 2321 (2016).\nSecurity Council Resolution 2371 of August 2017 completely banned the export of coal, iron, lead and seafood from Korea, imposed new restrictions on the Central Securities Depository's foreign trade bank, and banned an increase in the number of North Korean workers in other countries.\nResolution 2375 (2017) banned the import of oil and oil products by UN member states to the KSDR, the establishment of joint ventures with Korean capital, as well as the export of textiles and gas condensate from Korea to UN member states. This decree prohibited the citizens of the DPKR from working in other countries.\nIn accordance with UNSCR 2397 (2017), adopted in December 2017, the Security Council has tightened measures regarding the supply of any oil products to the DPRK, including the sale or transfer of diesel and oil. The resolution establishes a quota for oil and gas products (500,000 barrels within 12 months from 1 January 2018) and crude oil (4 million barrels or 525,000 tons within 12 months from 22 December 2017) and defines the obligations of countries to carry out such operations.\nUNSCR 2397 (2017) also expanded industry sanctions, banning thereby the export of food and agricultural products, machinery, electrical equipment, soil and stone, including magnetite and magnesia, lumber and fishing vessels. The Resolution also prohibits the transfer of fishing rights to the DPRK.\nUNSCR 2397 (2017) prohibits the supply of all industrial equipment, automobiles, iron, steel and other metals, with the exception of the delivery, sale or transfer of necessary spare parts of commercial passenger aircraft in operation by the DPRK.\nUNSCR 2397 (2017) tightens measures to prevent granting labor rights to DPRK citizens and obliges UN member states to repatriate within 24 months the DPRK state labor protection attaches and citizens who receive income on their territory.\nIt also tightens measures against the illegal export of coal and other illegal goods from the DPKR to the sea and the smuggling of oil into the DPKR by sea, and obliges countries to detain and inspect any vessel engaged in prohibited activities in its ports and territorial waters.\n \nNon-Proliferation Regimes                                       \nNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)[45]                                                                 \n\n\n[45] http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/\nhttp://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/about-nsg/nsg-faq\nThis is a group of countries with nuclear weapons. They seek to promote the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons by controlling the materials, equipment and technology that can be used to create nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group was formed in 1975 in response to India's nuclear weapons testing in 1974, using plutonium created in a Canadian nuclear reactor fueled by American heavy water. The Indian \"nuclear explosion\" showed that nuclear materials and technologies acquired for peaceful purposes could be used to create nuclear weapons.\nToday NSG unites 48 countries. To become a member of the NSG, a country must satisfy the following criteria:\n- Be able to supply products listed in the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group;\n- Observe guideline principles;\n- Create a legal framework for export controls, which will comply with the guidelines;\n- Comply with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Pelandaba, Rarotonga, Tlatelolco, Bangkok, Semipalatinsk or other equivalent international agreements (one or more) and fully implement such agreements (treaties);\n- Support international efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.\nThe Nuclear Suppliers Group has developed guidelines consisting of Part 1 and Part 2, setting forth rules for the transfer of nuclear materials and dual-use items for peaceful purposes so that such transfers do not lead to the creation of weapons of mass destruction.\nIn 1978, the International Atomic Energy Agency published Part 1 of the guidelines as a document IAEA INFCIRC/254.\n \nPart 1 of the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group regulates the export of items specifically designed or prepared for use in the nuclear field, such as: nuclear materials, nuclear reactors and related equipment, non-nuclear materials for reactors, equipment and apparatus for the development, enrichment and storage of nuclear materials, also production of nuclear fuel and heavy water; and the technology and software associated with each of the aforementioned.\nThese elements are known as \"elements of the trigger list\".\nPart 2 of the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group regulates the export of items related to the creation of nuclear weapons, items that can play an important role in the nuclear fuel cycle (production cycle, including all stages of extracting fuel from radioactive waste), and these items can have non-nuclear application. For example, used in industry. Such items are known as \"dual-use items\".\nPart 2 of the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (guidelines for dual-use items), was created in 1991-1992 after it became clear that the existing export control rules could not prevent one of the states parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty form implementing an underground nuclear weapons program, which in turn led to further UN actions. A significant part of the ground-based nuclear weapons program included the purchase of dual-use items and their use to create elements of the \"triggers list.\"\nIn 1992, the International Atomic Energy Agency published Part 2 of the guidelines as an information circular of the IAEA INFCIRC / 254, part 2.\n\n\n\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)[46]      \n\n\n[46] http://mtcr.info/\n\n\nThe Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is an informal and voluntary association of countries that have come together to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The MTCR was founded in 1987 by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Since then, the countries participating in the MTCR have grown to 35, and each country has equal rights under this regime.\n \nThe MTCR was created to counter the growing threat of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. If follows the general export policy guidelines, which are used with respect to the common list of controlled goods (Annex to the management of missile technology, which includes equipment, software and technology).\nThe MTCR does not make collective export licensing decisions. Instead, each country assumes the responsibility to protect the \"guidelines\" in accordance with national laws and practices. All decisions of the MTCR are based on general consensus, and partner countries regularly update information on national export licensing policies in the context of the overall objectives of the regime.\nThe Missile Technology Control Regime, which includes hardware, software and technology, consists of Category I and Category II equipment, which includes a wide range of military and dual-use equipment and technologies related to the design, production and operation of missiles. The application is periodically updated to clarify and account for today's rapidly developing technologies.\nMore stringent restrictions apply to the category I technical unit. These include advanced missile systems (including ballistic missiles, rocket launchers and sound rockets, cruise missiles, radio-controlled airplanes, target and reconnaissance airplanes) capable of delivering at least 500 kg payload to a range of at least 300 km.\nTechnical units of \"Category II\" include integrated missile systems (including ballistic missiles, rocket launchers and sound rocket, cruise missiles, radio-controlled airplanes, target and reconnaissance airplanes) able to fly at a maximum range of 300 km and not included in \"Category I\".\nTechnical units of \"Category II\" include a wide range of equipment, materials and technologies, most of which have a purpose different from the system of delivery of weapons of mass destruction. Regime member countries have an easier approach to \"Category II\" technical units, however, according to the agreement, the transfer of such units is limited.\nThe decision to admit a new member is taken by the partner countries unanimously on the basis of consensus. The decision takes into account the extent to which the country adheres to the principles of non-proliferation, whether it has an effective export control system that implements the guidelines and procedures of the regime at the national level.\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of export controls over missile technologies, systems, equipment, materials and components, MTCR has developed a Handbook, which explains what are MTCR controlled items and technologies, where are they used, how do they work, how they look, etc. The Handbook is quite extensive and contains technologies that are especially important in the design and manufacture of transport equipment[47].\n \n\n\n[47] http://mtcr.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MTCR-Handbook-2017-INDEXED-FINAL-Digital.pdf)\n\n\nAustralia group (AG)[48]\n\n\n[48] https://australiagroup.net/en/index.html\n\n\nThe Australia Group (AG) is an informal association of countries whose activities are aimed at minimizing risks of the spread of chemical and biological weapons (CB weapons), as well as the delivery of various types of materials by exporting countries or countries through which territories these materials are supplied.\nThe main objectives of the AG member states are to establish more stringent control measures so that the export licensing system can control the use of certain categories of chemicals and, biological agents, technologies and dual-use items that can be used for the production and distribution of chemical and biological weapons.\nAll countries participating in the Australia Group are also members of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and support international efforts to protect the world from the proliferation of CB weapons.\nToday, there are 43 countries in the Australia group and the European Commission, and Kazakhstan is awaiting membership. In early 1984, an investigation team discovered the use of chemical weapons in Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, which contradicted the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Iraq was also found to have purchased chemicals and related materials needed for the production of chemical weapons through legitimate trade channels.\nA set of control systems have been introduced in some countries in this regard to control the export of chemicals and materials that can be used to manufacture chemical weapons. Nevertheless, controls imposed by individual countries proved ineffective, and it became clear that stakeholders were trying to avoid these systems.\nIn connection with this situation, Australia invited the countries on whose territory export control is carried out to develop and harmonize the rules of national export licenses and improve the effectiveness of cooperation in this area.\nThe first meeting of these countries, the union of which was later called the Australia Group, was held in Brussels in June 1985. The fourteen countries that participated in this meeting and the European Commission agreed on the need to explore new export monitoring opportunities and ways of increasing their efficiency with regard to the non-proliferation of chemical weapons.\nIn the 1990s, due to the exposed facts of the use of dual-use items imported for random purposes, which were instead used for biological weapon programs, the AG countries imposed restrictions on the exports of certain biological agents. New technologies and equipment that can be used to manufacture or use chemical or biological weapons were added to the control lists of substances and materials developed by AG to restrict exports.\nCurrently, all states parties are taking certain measures to restrict the export of 65 types of chemicals that can be used as a source of chemical weapons. Mandatory export licenses are applied in the following areas:\n-        Chemical production facilities and dual-use equipment and related technologies;\n-        Plant pathogens;\n-        Animal pathogens;\n-        Biological agents; and\n-        Dual-use biological facilities.\nThese points are the basis of a common AG control list, which is compiled as a result of consultations between member states and is periodically adjusted to ensure improved efficiency. AG member states call on all countries to take the necessary measures to prevent the participation of enterprises located on their territories in the production of chemical and biological weapons.\nIn addition, although the guidelines of the Australian Group are consistent and comply with the requirements of the conventions on the prohibition of chemical and biological weapons, the implementation of these provisions is also mandatory for all other states to ensure compliance with the requirements of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n\n\nWassenar Agreement WA[49]  \n\n\n[49] https://www.wassenaar.org/\nOn December 19, 1995, the Wassenaar Agreement (WA) was established by a decision taken at the high-level meeting in Wassenaar (a village near The Hague, Netherlands), which became known after the announcement at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The Wassenaar Agreement was founded to protect regional and international security and stability by increasing transparency and high accountability for the transfer of conventional weapons and dual-use products and technologies, thereby preventing dangerous accumulation and seizure of weapons and technology by terrorists. Today, the Wassenaar Arrangement is made up of 42 countries that make decisions based on general consensus. The language of the WA is English.\n \nThe basis of the WA and the obligations of its member states with respect to the control of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies are determined by the following document \"Guidelines & Procedures, including the Initial Elements\"[50].\nWA control lists consist of two parts\n-        A list of dual-use items and technologies that can be used to create weapons and military equipment (the Basic List), which is divided into two parts - a Sensitive List and a Very Sensitive List of items and technologies[51];\n-        Munitions List[52].\nThe basic list includes 9 categories of products and technologies: Special materials and related equipment; material processing; electronics; computers; telecommunications and information security; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; aerospace and propulsion.\nA new member to the Wassenaar Arrangement is to be admitted with the consent of all member states by consensus.\nTo become a WA member, a country must engage in the production of military items and industrial equipment used to create military products or export such products, and also must recognize non-proliferation policies, including the NSG, MTCR, AG, NPT, CWC, BWC and other rules and must have an efficient export control system.\n \n1.2.

Such may be, for example, special fissile materials and various radionuclides;\n- Certificate of special training of the driver for the transport of dangerous goods, certificate of admission of the vehicle, document confirming the positive result of the periodic technical inspection of the vehicle (if necessary). These documents are required if the dual-use product is at the same time a dangerous cargo in accordance with the European Agreement on International Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Geneva, 30 September 1957) and the legislation of Georgia.\n- For example, potassium cyanide (cas 151-50-8, UN1680, ECCN 1C350.40), chloropicrin (cas 76-06-2 ,, UN 1580, ECCN 1C450.a.7), etc. .ش).;\n - Permit / authorization for international cargo transportation by road transport provided by Georgia's multilateral international and bilateral agreements.\n \nElectronically issued permit for import / export / transit of dual-use products, uploaded in the \"Unified Electronic System of Licenses, Permits and Certificates\", is considered as submitted at the customs checkpoint and submission of the permit in material form is not required.\n \nIf during the general declaration of dual-use products imported into Georgia, a permit for import / transit of dual-use products was not submitted, the authorized officer of the customs checkpoint or customs office shall issue a \"notice of intention to dispose of the goods\" to the declarant, stating that if the declarant does not submit the permit within three working days, or the goods are not returned, the customs authority shall dispose of the goods.\n \nWhen importing goods into the customs territory, in order to carry out permit control, the customs officer at the customs checkpoint carries out the initial identification of the goods, which means that according to the HS code and the submitted documents he finds out whether any permit/license is necessary to import the goods into Georgia. Commodity HS code verification is carried out by the so-called \"Correlation table\".\n \nPursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the said Order, the final decision on the attribution of goods for dual-use products shall be taken in accordance with the technical parameters of the controlled products specified in the list of dual-use products approved by Article 1 (b) of the Ordinance of the Government of Georgia №394 of June 13, 2014 on approval of Military and Dual-Use Products control lists and in accordance with its explanations and remarks.\n \nConsequently, the coincidence of the commodity HS code does not unequivocally mean that the specific goods belong to the goods specified in the control list, and in order to finally identify and determine whether the goods are subject to permit control, it is necessary to find information about the technical characteristics of these goods, which are often associated with difficulties in moving goods across the customs border.\n \nInformation on the technical characteristics of the product can also be obtained from the data specified in the enclosed documents of the goods (transport consignment note, packing lists, invoices, declarations, cargo manifests, etc.), such as the name and description of the goods, make, model, commodity HS code of the goods, value of the goods, sender, consignee, information on the classification in the control lists, etc.\n \nFor more information, the customs officer has the right to request additional documentation about the goods, e.g. Export Declaration, Certificate of Origin, Certificate of Quality, Technical Passport, Security Passport (MSDS), Export Permit issued in the sending country, laboratory or expert report, etc.\n \nIn order to identify the goods, the customs officer has the right to inspect the goods: use technical means (portable analyzers, detectors, X-ray inspection systems), open the containers and packaging of sealed vehicles and take samples. When checking the goods and documents, attention is also paid to the dimensions of the goods, the information on the packaging and directly to the product, the conditions of shipping, the features, the route, etc. The discovery of discrepancies in the submitted documentation may give rise to a reasonable suspicion that unlawful shipment is taking place, that permit control is being avoided, or that we are dealing with illegal trade in strategic goods. The customs officer of the customs checkpoint sends the information about the goods to the Non-Tariff Control Division of the Customs Department, where this information is analyzed and examined in detail and the conformity of the characteristics of the specific goods with the characteristics of similar goods in the control lists is determined. Information on the sanctions provided for in UN resolutions or international treaties or agreements against the sending country or exporter, or the person involved in trade, is also verified.\n \nIf it is determined that the goods are dual-use products and require a permit for import / transit, the customs procedures for importation into the customs territory of Georgia shall be suspended and the customs authority shall allow the declarant to submit the permit within the prescribed time limits. In this case:\nThe declarant must apply to the Standing Commission on Military-Technical Issues of the Ministry of Defense of Georgia for a recommendation;\nAfter receiving the recommendation, the declarant must apply electronically to the Service/Clearance Division of the Customs Clearance Zone of the Customs Department for a dual-use import / transit permit.\nIf the declarant fails to submit the permit within the prescribed period, the goods will be returned to the sending country.

The goods are identified by the Non-Tariff Control Division using the information provided in the technical documentation, oper sources and on the manufacturer's website. In the process of identification it is possible to use physical and various technical means of inspection of goods, examination, laboratory analysis etc. At the same time, the factor of destination country, importer, end user and end-use of goods is taken into account, so that the specific transaction does not violate Georgia's international obligations regarding trade in strategic goods and the requirements established by the legislation of Georgia.\n \nIf the declarant has received a written response from the Customs Department that the product is dual-use, the declarant shall upload the application for a permit electronically on the website of the Revenue Service (https://rs.ge/), from so-called \"Tax Payer's Page\", in addition, the application is attached electronically by the documents required to obtain a permit.\n \nIf the product is marked with one (*) or two (**) asterix in the control list, before obtaining the permit, the declarant must apply to the Standing Commission on Military-Technical Affairs of the Ministry of Defense of Georgia for a recommendation. The application will be reviewed by a CCZ customs officer authorized to issue a permit of the Customs Department:\n- Checks the correctness of filling out the application;\n- Documents submitted for obtaining a permit.\nIf the application and the submitted documents meet the requirements established by law, the customs officer will issue a permit.\n \nThe permit shall be submitted together with the customs declaration to the customs checkpoint of exit, where the said permit shall be closed (in case of full withdrawal of the quantity of goods provided by the permit) or extended (in case of withdrawal of part of the quantity of goods provided by the permit).\n\n\n3.3.

Document confirming labor management of the carrier;\n \nIn this case, it is the duty of the customs officer of the customs crossing point and/or customs clearance zone to check the correctness and conformity of the ECMT permit and associate certificates, the data recorded in the logbook, and the driver's legal ownership of the vehicle and the carrier.\n \nAfter completing the documentary check, the customs officer fills in the electronic form of ECMT permit in the \"unified electronic system of licenses, permits and certificates\" (unified electronic system) and makes the appropriate markings;\n \nAt the request of the driver, the official of the customs authority shall confirm with a personal numbered stamp the information on the movement of the vehicle acrossing the customs border of Georgia in the appropriate column of the logbook.\n \nIn case of submission of BSEC or TRACECA permit by the driver of the vehicle moving at the customs border of Georgia, it is the duty of the customs officer of customs crossing point and/or customs clearance zone to check the correctness of the filling of the permit and accompanying documents. Indicate the type of international road transport operation to be carried out with a permit;\n \nIf the BSEC or TRACECA permit is submitted by a driver of a vehicle crossing the customs border of Georgia, the duty of the official of the CCPs/CCZs is to check the correctness of filling in the permit and accompanying documents, as well as indicate the type of international road transport that must be carried out with an above permits;\n \nAt the request of the driver, the official of the customs authority shall indicate the date and time of the movement of the vehicle on/through the customs territory of Georgia in the appropriate column of the material form of the permit and confirm this with a personal stamp.\n \nIn the case of a vehicle moving under the authorization provided by the bilateral agreements of Georgia at the customs border of Georgia, the customs officer of the customs crossing point and/or customs clearance zone shall verify the correctness of the authorization and accompanying documents.\n \nIn the case of moving a vehicle across the customs border of Georgia on the basis of a permit provided for by bilateral agreements of Georgia, an official of the customs authority of the CCP/CCZ checks the correctness of the permit and accompanying documents.\n \nAt the request of the driver, the date and time of the movement of the vehicle across the customs border of Georgia is indicated in the permit and confirmed by a stamp with a personal number.\n \nIf the vehicle has performed a transport operation stipulated by one of the types of permit/authorization, at the time of departure from the customs territory of Georgia, the official of the customs checkpoint closes the electronic form of the permit in the unified electronic system and corresponding permit/authorization is considered used.\n \nIn the case of a special permit for the international carriage of goods by road from the territory of Georgia (above the quota established by international agreements of Georgia), a customs official checks the validity and compliance of the permit presented in material form with the electronic one uploaded to the unified electronic system. At the request of the driver, in the appropriate column of the permit, he/she indicates the date and time of movement of the vehicle on/through the customs border of Georgia and confirms this with a stamp with a personal number.\n \nIf a driver engaged in the international carriage of goods by road with a vehicle registered in a foreign state fails to present the relevant permit/authorisation at the customs checkpoint upon entry/exit from the customs territory of Georgia, he/she shall be given a deadline for submitting the relevant permit/authorisation, which is 3 to 6 working days.\n \nFor violation of the rules for the implementation of international transport operations, an administrative offense report is drawn up, and the vehicle must be returned to the country of entry.\n \nWhen carrying out international transportation of goods through a bilateral and/or from/to a third country, if an appropriate permit/authorization is not presented to the CCZ, such a vehicle will be allowed to carry out international transportation of goods only after the submission of the appropriate permit/authorization. \n\n\n5.3. Strategic Goods as Dangerous Goods (in terms of transportation)[74]\n\n\n[74] https://unece.org/transport/standards/transport/dangerous-goods/adr-2023-agreement-concerning-international-carriage\n\n\nOften strategic goods are or may contain chemical, biological, radioactive and explosive substances, so their transportation can cause irreparable damage to human life and the environment. Due to their properties, such goods are included in the control lists of military and dual-use goods.\n \nFor example, ML3 and ML4 of the military control list include ammunition, explosives, bombs, torpedoes, rocket-propelled grenades, missiles and other explosive devices and charges;\n \nML7 includes chemicals and biologically toxic agents, mass control agents, radioactive materials, while ML8 includes energy materials and related substances, such as: explosives and their compounds, rocket fuels, pyrotechnics, aviation fuels and their precursors.\n \nThe dual use items control list includes natural radioactive materials, special fissile materials (0С001, 0С002, 1C012, 1C236), metal powders (1C002, 1C011, 1C240), rocket fuel and rocket fuel chemicals (1C111), high explosives, electric detonators, various types of explosives (1C239, 1A008), toxic chemicals and substances that can be used as precursors for production of the toxic chemical agents (1C350, 1C450), biological agents (1C351, 1C352, 1C353, 1C354).\n \nAccordingly, Table A of the ADR agreement includes goods with dangerous properties, the rules for the carriage of which by road are provided for by this agreement.\n \nStrategic goods in Table A are identified by the assigned UN number, hazard class, packing class, packing instructions and special provisions, as well as transport rules that must be observed during their transportation.\n \nFor example, consider the rules for the transport of certain chemical and biological agents and radioactive materials included in the control lists of military and dual-use items.\nChemicals\nAlmost all strategic chemicals are poisonous, irritant, corrosive, flammable or explosive. When transporting such chemicals and substances, transport documents, product labels and markings must contain full information about the name and hazardous properties of such products.\nOne such important document is the MSDS (material safety data sheet), a document issued by the chemical industry that illustrates technical information about the physical and chemical properties of a product.\nThe MSDS consists of sixteen sections that give the following basic information about a substance: name, unique CAS number (U.S. chemical reference service), manufacturer and shipper details, name of each ingredient in the product, CAS number and percentage ratio, physical and chemical condition and properties of the substance, toxic data, warning instructions, first aid measures, classification under the UN model regulations etc.\n \nChemicals may be transported in cisterns, opening tanks, container-cisterns, barrels, cans, cartons, sacks, gas cylinders, etc., in compliance with the provisions of the ADR agreement. Each individual package, outer package and vehicles must be labeled and marked in accordance with the recommendations of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) and the ADR agreement:\n \nEach individual transport package, outer packaging and means of transport must be marked and labeled in accordance with the recommendations of the globally harmonized system of chemical classification and labeling (GHS) and the ADR agreement:\n \nThe exact name of the substance must be written on the inner and/or outer packaging, as well as the CAS number, the UN number and the hazardous placard indicating the dangerous goods;\n \nAuto and rail cisterns, containers and other lorries must be marked with hazardous rhombus board / boards and orange board / boards.\n \nRoad and rail tankers, containers and vehicles must be marked with dangerous placards and orange plates in the front and rear of any vehicle transporting hazardous goods.\n \nHere are some strategic chemicals shown in Table A of chapter 3.2 of ADR Agreement:\n \n\nUN\n\n№\n\n\t\n\nName anddescription\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.2\n\n\t\n\nClass\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2\n\n\t\n\nClassification\n\ncode\n\n \n\n \n\n2.2\n\n\t\n\nPacking group\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3\n\n\t\n\nLabels\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.2\n\n\t\n\nSpecial provisions\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3\n\n\t\n\nLimited and excepted quantities\n\n\t\n\n \n\nPackaging\n\n\t\n\nPortable tanks and bulk containers\n\n\t\n\n\nPacking instructions\n\n4.1.4\n\n\t\n\nSpecial packing provisions\n\n4.1.4\n\n\t\n\nMixed packaging provisions\n\n4.1.10\n\n\t\n\nInstructions\n\n4.2.5.2.\n\n7.3.2\n\n\t\n\nSpecial provisions\n\n4.2.5.3\n\n\t\n\n\n3.4.6\n\n\t\n\n3.5.1.2\n\n\t\n\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\n(3a)\n\n\t\n\n(3 b)\n\n\t\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\n(7a)\n\n\t\n\n(7 b)\n\n\t\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\n(9a)\n\n\t\n\n(9 b)\n\n\t\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\n\n1076\n\n\t\n\nPhosgene\n\n\t\n\n2\n\n\t\n\n2TC\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2.3\n\n+8\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE0\n\n\t\n\nP200\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nMP9\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n\n1613\n\n\t\n\nHYDROCYANIC ACID, AQUEOUS\n\nSOLUTION (HYDROGEN\n\nCYANIDE, AQUEOUS SOLUTION)\n\nwith not more than 20% hydrogen\n\ncyanide\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nTF1\n\n\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n+3\n\n\t\n\n48\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE5\n\n\t\n\nP601\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nMP8\n\nMP17\n\n\t\n\nT14\n\n\t\n\nTP2\n\n\t\n\n\n1614\n\n\t\n\nHYDROGEN CYANIDE,\n\nSTABILIZED, containing less than\n\n3% water and absorbed in a porous\n\ninert material\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nTF1\n\n\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n+3\n\n\t\n\n603\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE5\n\n\t\n\nP099\n\nP601\n\n\t\n\nRR10\n\n\t\n\nMP2\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n\n1680\n\n\t\n\nPOTASSIUM CYANIDE, SOLID\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nT5\n\n\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE5\n\n\t\n\nP002\n\nIBC07\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nMP18\n\n\t\n\nT6\n\n\t\n\nTP33\n\n\t\n\n\n1689\n\n\t\n\nSODIUM CYANIDE, SOLID\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nT5\n\n\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE5\n\n\t\n\nP002\n\nIBC07\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nMP18\n\n\t\n\nT6\n\n\t\n\nTP33\n\n\t\n\n\n2810\n\n\t\n\nTOXIC LIQUID (Zarine, Iprites, Amiton, VX), ORGANIC, N.O.S.\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nT1\n\n\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\n274\n\n315\n\n614\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nE5\n\n\t\n\nP001\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\nMP8\n\nMP17\n\n\t\n\nT14\n\n\t\n\nTP2\n\nTP27\n\n\t\n\n\n2811\n\n\t\n\nTOXIC SOLID, ORGANIC, N.O.S.

belong to the class 7 of dangerous goods.\n \nRadioactive material is assigned a UN number depending on the level of activity of the radionuclides contained in the package, whether or not they are fissile, the type of package used for transport, the nature and form of the contents of the package, or special conditions regulating shipping operations.\n \nAccordingly, radioactive materials are divided into:\n-     Low specific activity materials (LSA),\n-     A surface contaminated objects (SCO)\n-     Special form of radioactive materials (either a single solid piece or must be contained in a sealed capsule that can be opened only by destroying the capsule to qualify as special form), and are classified according to the following types of packaging:\n \na.      Excepted packages- used for very small quantities of radioactive material and do not require external marking.\nb.      Industrial packages- used to transport low-specific activity (LSA) material or surface-contaminated objects (SCO), for example low-activity naturally radioactive ores;\nc.      Type A packaging- designed for the safe transport of relatively small quantities of radioactive materials;\nd.      Type B packaging- used to transport larger amounts of radioactive materials and are designed to withstand the effects of severe accidents.\n \nRadioactive materials and their packaging must comply with the requirements of chapter 6.4 of ADR agreement, for example:\n \nThe amount of radioactive material in the package must not exceed the established limit; All types of packaging must be designed with weight, volume and shape in mind to ensure easy and safe delivery. In addition, the design of the package must be such that it can be properly secured to the vehicle during transport.\n \nAll types of packaging must be able to withstand any acceleration, vibration or vibrational resonance that may occur under normal conditions of transport without compromising the effectiveness of the various locking devices of the container or without compromising the integrity of the package as a whole.\n \nIn particular, bolts and other fastening details must be designed so that they cannot be loosened or removed arbitrarily, even after repeated use.\n \nThe material of the packaging and any element or construction must be physically and chemically compatible with each other and with the radioactive contents. It is necessary to take into account their reaction under the effect of radiation.\n \nFor example: All valves from which radioactive contents may come out must be must be secured against tampering.\n \nThe documents for the carriage of goods of class 7 must indicate:\n \n-     The name and symbol of each radionuclide, or, in the case of radionuclide compounds, their corresponding general description or list of the most limiting nuclides;\n-     Description of physical and chemical forms of materials;\n-     Maximum activity of radioactive contents during shipment;\n \nPackaging category (I-white, II-yellow, III-yellow);\nTransport index only for categories II-yellow, III-yellow (transport index is the magnitude of the radiation dose at a distance of 1 m from the surface of the package).\n \nWhen transporting radioactive materials, the packaging must be marked with the following hazardous placards:\n\n\nThe number 7 referring to the class 7 of dangerous goods, must be indicated on two opposite sides of the package.\n \nCorrelation Table of ADR Regulated Dangerous Goods with Military and Dual-Use Items\n \n\n\n\nUN

Risk Management System for Goods Subject to Customs Clearance.\nRisk management system\nThe purpose of using the customs risk management system is to increase the efficiency of customs control, optimize material and human resources, and facilitate foreign trade by simplifying customs procedures. Customs control and formalities for goods subject to customs supervision are carried out by the customs authority via risk management system. Instruction on “the Rules for Implementing Customs Risks in the Revenue Service” is approved by the order №3722 of the Head of the Revenue Service dated February 21, 2018.\nIn order to control the management of customs risks, the Revenue Service has established a commission, the composition of which and the rules for the implementation of customs risk management are approved by the Revenue Service. The Commission supervises customs risk management, evaluates its effectiveness at least twice a year, and develops and considers proposals for improving the risk management policy.\nRisk - any action or event that may affect the quality of customs control and/or create a risk of violation of the requirements of the legislation of Georgia when moving goods and/or during customs clearance.\nRisk management comprises the definition of risk management policy and risk management strategy, risk identification, analysis and evaluation, development and use of risk profiles. Risk identification and creation of risk profiles in the Customs Department is carried out by the Customs Risk Management Division. Various structural units/subdivisions of the Customs Department systematically process the information related to the risks in their field of activity and provide this information to the Risk Management Division. Any employee of the Customs Department is authorized to provide information about the potential risk to the Division. Head/ Deputy Head of Customs Risk Management Division acts as a risk manager. Risk management is fully automated in the electronic data system \"eCustoms\" and/or the tax administration information system \"Oracle\" through the built-in risk management system.\nRisk Identification\nRisk identification includes:\na. Determination of the area/direction to which the risk management system should respond;\nb. Identifying the specific circumstances under which or during which an action or event occurs;\nc. Definition of risk;\nd. Determination of the risk owner .\nAn assessment is carried out to respond to the identified risk. Identified risks will be assessed (classified) according to risk priority and volume. Risk priority is determined taking into account its probability and expected consequences, for which:\na. Each risk is assigned a coefficient of \"probability\" (from 1 to 3) and \"outcome\" (from 1 to 3), respectively;\nb. The \"significance\" of each risk is estimated by multiplying the \"probability\" and \"outcome\" coefficients;\nc. Risk whose \"significance\" has been assessed as relatively high will be considered as a priority compared to less significant risk.\nThe scope of the risk is defined in order to determine the risk owner, for which the risks are divided into national and local risks. The identified risks and the results of their analysis are reflected in the \"Identified Customs Risk Register\", which is generated electronically and used to guide the risk management process. Based on the risks registered in the \"Identified Customs Risk Register\", risk profiles are developed.\nThe risk profile consists of the following three main components:\na. From certain data (risk indicators or risk-specific details) that make it possible to evaluate the task:\n1. Risk criteria, such as specific commodity code, country of origin, country of consignment, cost, importer/exporter, vehicle, reason for staying in the customs territory, financial consequences, financial situation of the trader/person, etc .;\n2. Period during which the profile is active;\n3. Scope of risk specific to the structural units of the Customs Department (land border, airport, port, border crossing point, customs clearance zone, etc.);\n4. Required resources, available resources, etc .;\nb. From specific measures to be taken to respond to the risk and recommendations on how to conduct the audit;\nc. From the frequency of use of the risk profile, which is determined by analyzing the probability and priority of the risk, based on statistical data and analysis of operations performed in the past period.\nThe risk profile is approved by the risk manager in agreement with the risk owner.\nThe Risk Owner\nThe risk owner is determined by the scope of the risk and it can be:\na) National risk owner - Head of Customs Department/Deputy Head/Head of Division;\nb) Local risk owner- the head of the structural unit of the Customs Crossing Point or Customs Clearance Zone.\n \nThe risk owner participates in the process of creating, modifying and deleting risk profiles and is responsible for managing the consequences of the risk and control mechanisms in the area of his competence; If the declared goods match the risk profile, the corresponding customs declaration corridor for goods registered in the system is determined, which means:\na. \"Green Corridor\" - the release of goods without inspection of declaration and transport documents and inspection of goods, which does not exclude the implementation of customs control measures in individual cases;\nb. \"Blue corridor\" - release of goods without verification of declaration and transport documents and inspection of goods, subject to the necessary post-release control, which may include checking the customs value of goods and / or import duties and / or determining the HS code and/or checking the correctness of the quantity of goods or the number of types of goods and/or compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Georgia related to prohibitions and restrictions imposed on goods;\nc. \"Yellow corridor\" - Clearance of goods without inspection of goods, full or partial verification of declarations and accompanying documents;\nd. \"Red Corridor\" - clearance of goods by inspection of declared goods with or without full verification of the declaration and accompanying documents.\nThe declarant will be notified electronically about the measures to be taken.\n \nPost-Audit control of goods (post-audit)\nThe purpose of the post-audit control of the release of goods is to verify compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Georgia related to the collection of import duties and/or the customs value of goods, and/or the quantity of goods and/or the accuracy of the HS code and/or prohibitions and restrictions on goods. The post-audit is carried out by the Post-Release Inspection Division of the Customs Department.\n \nThe need for further control of the release of goods arises:\na. In case of customs declaration or re-export declaration falls in blue corridor;\nb. If the declarant has indicated in writing that the actual quantity of released goods and/or the quantity and/or customs value of goods and/or the amount of import duty is less than indicated in the customs declaration or re-export declaration and accompanying documentation;\nc. If appropriate verification is necessary in connection with the results of the analysis of data in the customs authority and/or information requested and received in the prescribed manner, including information received in the framework of international cooperation and mutual assistance.\nd. If there is an appropriate decision and/or information from the law enforcement agency.\nFurther control of the release of the goods is carried out by the order of the authorized person of the customs authority. The types of post-audit control of goods are individual and complex. Post-audit control of an individual type - verification of goods released under a single customs declaration or a re-export declaration, or a re-export notice, or a temporary storage declaration, or a general declaration for the import/export of goods;\n \nPost-audit controls for complex goods include:\na. Checking the customs formalities performed by the declarant and/or the person on a specific type of goods;\nb. Checking the specific customs procedure or re-export or temporary storage or import/export of goods carried out by the declarant;\nc. Checking customs formalities performed by the declarant for a certain period;\nForms of post-audit control of goods can be documentary checks and on-site checks. A post-audit documentary check is carried out in the customs control zone, without going to the place of activity of the person, on the basis of documents and other information related to customs formalities.\nDocumentary check can be used for both individual and complex inspections.\n \nWhen performing a documentary check, the customs authority has the right to:\n \na. Independently determine the customs value of the goods and/or the amount of customs and/or tax liability of the declarant based on the information available to the customs authority;\nb. To request from the declarant or a person to submit documentation related to the import and/or export operations of the declared goods, accounting data and/or other information (including the transportation of goods, reloading, storage, customs procedure or re-export or temporary storage or import/export of goods, determination of the amount of customs and/or tax liability and fulfillment of this obligation)\nc. To present it to the customs authority, contact the declarant or a person (having the relevant documentation and/or information) and obtain from the declarant written and oral explanations on issues that arose during the post-audit control of goods.\n \nAt least 10 working days before the start of the on-site post-audit control of the goods, the declarant and/or person (the owner or his representative and/or any person directly or indirectly involved in the transaction related to the goods) shall be notified in writing or electronically. The on-site inspection must start no later than 30 days after the notification to the declarant and/or the person. If the inspection is not started within the specified period, the notification shall be considered invalid. The on-site inspection can be used for both individual and complex inspections. On-site inspection can last no more than 3 months. If necessary, in agreement with the head of the Revenue Service, it is possible to extend the inspection period by no more than 2 months.\n \nWhen conducting an on-site inspection, the customs authority has the right to:\n \na.Request from the declarant and/or the person to provide relevant documentation, accounting data and/or other information (including the transportation of goods, reloading, storage, customs procedure or re-export or temporary storage or import and export of goods, determination of the amount of customs and/or tax liability and fulfillment of this obligation) on import and/or export operations of goods.\n \nb. Receive written and oral explanations from the declarant and/or the person (who has the relevant documentation and/or information) on the issues raised during the on-site inspection;\nc. Inspect the goods and/or take a sample, if the goods can be inspected and/or sampled.\nd. Post-audit inspection of the goods may be urgent (urgent on-site inspection). An urgent on-site inspection is conducted without written notice if:\ne. The customs authority has information that the declarant intends to avoid fulfilling customs and/or tax obligations by leaving the customs territory of Georgia, transferring goods to another person, destroying, concealing, amending or changing customs documents and/or taking other measures;\nf. There is a reasonable doubt that the customs declaration/re-export declaration and the accompanying documentation were incorrectly classified, which led to a reduction in the amount of import/export duty or thus the avoidance of prohibitions restrictions imposed on the goods by Georgian legislation;\ng. There is information that the goods placed in the procedure for specified use, are not used for the intended purpose or in violation of customs formalities used for other intended purposes.\n \nThe customs authority is obliged to apply to the court within 48 hours after the start of the urgent inspection and obtain permission from it to conduct the inspection. At the same time, the customs authority has the right to issue a tax lien/mortgage on the property of the declarant and/or person, regardless of whether he/she has a tax debt. The customs authority is not entitled to start an urgent inspection before obtaining the permission of the court. Representatives of the customs authority have the right to seal only those customs and/or tax documents and goods and material assets that are necessary for conducting an urgent on-site inspection of the declarant and/or person.\n \nIf the court does not give permission to the customs authority to conduct an urgent on-site inspection within the established period, the customs authority removes the seals on the customs and/or tax documents and/or goods and material assets of the declarant.\n \nDuring the documentary or on-site inspection, the results are formalized by the “Post-Audit Control Inspection Act”. If the specifics of the post-audit control of goods require several stages of control, an interim act is drawn up after each stage.\n \nUpon post audit control of the goods:\na. If an administrative offense is detected, the authorized person of the customs authority shall draw up a report on the administrative offense;\nb. If signs of a crime are found, the relevant materials are immediately sent to the relevant investigative body;\nc. If there is a customs offense, the authorized person of the customs authority shall record the results in the \"Post-control inspection act\" of the goods.\n \nContainer Control Program (CCP)\nAccording to the United Nations and the World Customs Organization, 500-750 million containers are shipped worldwide each year, accounting for 90% of total trade turnover, and only 2% of this number of containers are inspected.\n           \nThe incredible number of containers moving from country to country, from continent to continent, is a convenient opportunity for those involved in the illegal trade in drugs, counterfeit goods, weapons and strategic goods.\n \nDue to the large volume of cargo, lack of personnel in law enforcement agencies, the complexity of processes in the seaport and many other circumstances, the inspection of most containers is not possible, which makes it convenient to use container transportation for smuggling and illegal delivery of goods.\n \nTo minimize these risks, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the World Customs Organization (WCO) jointly launched the Container Control Program in 2004 to help governments establish enforcement structures at selected seaports to prevent the cross-border movement of illegal goods. .\n \nThe Container Control Program currently operates in more than 70 countries, with more than 120 Port Control Units (PCUs) and Air Cargo Control Units (ACCUs).\n           \nA joint project of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the World Customs Organization (WCO), the Container Control Program, was established in Georgia by the Memorandum of Understanding of April 23, 2012, signed by the UNODC and Between the LEPL Revenue Service of the Ministry of Finance, the Special Operational Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Patrol Police Department.\n \nBy a joint order N938/N350 of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Minister of Finance of Georgia dated November 28, 2014, a working group on the prevention, detection and suppression of drug trafficking was established and powers and rules for the activities of this group were determined.\n \nAccording to the order, the working group includes the employees of the Central Criminal Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Legal Entity of Public Law - the Revenue Service.\n \nWorking group:\n a. Monitors the entry and exit of cargo on the territory of Georgia;\n b. Carries out assessment and analysis of threats and risks related to illicit trafficking of drugs on the basis of the obtained information;\n c. Develops proposals for the prevention, detection and suppression of illicit drug trafficking and submits them to the competent authority;\n d. Participates in measures planned for the prevention, detection and suppression of illicit drug trafficking.\n \nIn case of detection of signs of crime and other offenses, the members of the working group, who are equipped with the relevant official powers, shall carry out the measures provided for by the legislation of Georgia.\nThe Working Group, in exercising its powers, if necessary, has the right to use the electronic information available to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Ministry of Finance of Georgia, including databases, information and registration cards, files and other means necessary for the implementation of its functions and tasks.\n \nThe identity of the employees of the Revenue Service, who are involved in the joint working group (working group) operating within the framework of the Container Control Program, the place of work and the working time of the group are determined by the order of the Head of the Revenue Service.\n \nIn 2012, the first unit under the Container Control Program in Georgia started operating in the city of Poti, which focused on the control of sea containers.\n \nIn 2015, the Tbilisi Interagency Division was established and its scope of work includes customs crossing points and customs economic zones.\nIn 2017, a third group was set up to control air cargo and parcels.\nThe working group consists of a total of 19 members, including: 10 customs officers and analysts from the Customs Department, 2 Investigative Services, 4 Patrol Police and 3 Central Criminal Police.\n \nThe working group's area of operation includes land, sea and air customs crossing points, clearance economic zones and free industrial zones.\n \nThe subject of research and control of the working group is the illegal circulation and smuggling of drugs and precursors, weapons and ammunition, strategic products and counterfeit products.\n\n\nSection 7. Relations of the Customs Service with State Agencies, Bodies and Stakeholders\n \n7.1. Interagency Cooperation\nStanding Commission on Military-Technical Issues, Interagency Expert Group.\nIn cases provided by law, the Customs Department of the LEPL Revenue Service issues permits for dual-use goods on the basis of the conclusion of the Standing Commission (Commission) on Military-Technical Issues of the Ministry of Defense. The recommendation is an individual administrative-legal act of the Commission.\nThe statute of the Standing Commission on Military-Technical Issues is approved by the Order №68 of the Minister of Defense of Georgia of August 4, 2020. The composition of the commission is determined by the individual administrative-legal act of the Minister (MOD 3 19 00000586, 01.10.2019).\nThe Commission consists of six members, including:\na.

In case of equality of votes, the vote of the head of the expert group is decisive. The protocol of the meeting of the group of experts is drawn up and signed by all members of the group present at the meeting, taking into account their position. The protocol of the meeting of the group of experts is the basis for making a recommendation to the Commission.\nThe issue of recommendation regarding the transfer of dual-use goods will be considered by the panel and the commission if:\nDual-use goods are marked with one (*) asterisk in the control list (e.g. 0A001*, 0B001*, 0B002*, 0B004*, 1A007*, 0C001*, 1A008.c*, etc. items classified by ECCN);\nExport, import, transit, brokering service and/or technical assistance in respect of dual-use goods are carried out to/from a country subject to UN Security Council sanctions/embargoes (in this case, the goods are considered to be marked with two (**) asterisks);\nItems not included in the control list (e.g., uncontrolled machines, commonly used chemicals, test stands, etc.) but there is a reasonable doubt that they will be used in whole or in part, or may be used in the development, production, distribution of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery, or for military purposes (the so-called principle Catch-All Controls).\nIn the above cases, when issuing a permit for dual-use goods, along with other documents required for obtaining a permit, a positive recommendation of the Commission must be submitted to the Customs Department.\nNuclear and Radiation Safety Agency\nThe Nuclear and Radiation Safety Agency (Agency) is a legal entity of public law within the system of the Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture (Ministry) of Georgia. The Agency carries out state regulation and control in the field of nuclear and radiation safety, inspection and authorization of nuclear and radiation activities, responds to radiation alarms at border crossing points, as well as at customs and transport terminals in cooperation with the Customs Service and other law enforcement agencies.\nThe Agency issues licenses for various types of nuclear and radiation activities, including the transport of nuclear materials, radioactive sources and radioactive waste. The holder of this license, when transporting radioactive materials by motor vehicle, must comply with the requirements of the The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) for the safe transport of radioactive materials.\nThe agency issues the following permits:\na. Permit to purchase and transfer radioactive materials;\nb. Permit to import, export and transit of radioactive materials, raw materials from which nuclear material may be obtained or manufactured, equipment containing radioactive substances, import, export of nuclear technology or know-how; and radioactive sources (including radiopharmaceuticals);\nc. Permit for export of radioactive waste.\nThe above-mentioned \"b\" and \"c\" permits are uploaded by the Agency in the \"Unified Electronic System of Licenses, Permits and Certificates\" and when moving radioactive and ionizing materials across the customs border, these permits are submitted electronically to the customs crossing point. These permits are issued for a single action, for one specific consignment of goods, for a period of one year. When importing radiopharmaceuticals for medical purposes, a permit may be issued for multiple actions for a period of 1 year. Information on the import and export of radioactive materials to Georgia shall be provided by the Customs Department to the Agency in the form prescribed by the legislation in order to carry out permit control. Along with the issuance of a permit for the import, export and transit of nuclear materials included in the control list (for example: ECCNs 0C001, 0C002, 1C012, 1C235, 1C236, 1C237, 1C239), the permit issued by the Agency for mentioned products must be submitted to the Customs Department.\nInvestigation Service of the Ministry of Finance\nThe Investigation Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia is a special law enforcement body within the system of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia with the status of a state subordinate body that fights crime in the financial and economic sphere in accordance with the legislation of Georgia.

In this case, the goods can be disposed of by transferring them to state ownership or by destroying the goods at the expense of the owner or possessor.\n \nb. Customs offenses and liabilities provided by the Customs Code on customs offenses\n \nA customs offense is an unlawful act (act or omission) of a person, for the commitment of which the Customs Code of Georgia provides for liability. A customs sanction is a measure of liability imposed for the committment of a customs offense. There are several types of customs sanctions: warning, fine, confiscation of goods and / or vehicles subject to customs offenses. The responsibility for committing a customs offense lies with the person who committed the relevant act, and if the offender is more than one, they shall be jointly and severally liable under this Code. A person may not be held liable for committing the same customs offense repeatedly.\n \nA customs offense shall be deemed to have been committed repeatedly if the same act has been committed within 12 months of the detection of the previous customs offense. When detecting several customs offenses, a separate customs sanction is applied to each customs offense. In addition, a stricter customs sanction does not absorb a less stringent customs sanction. A liability provided for in the Customs Code for committing a customs offense may not be imposed on a person if the act constituting this customs offense entails the imposition of criminal liability. The customs authority / dispute settlement body or the court has the right to release a person from a customs sanction if the relevant customs offense was not intentional and was committed by mistake / unknowingly.\n \nA person is not liable for committing a customs offense if this customs offense is caused by an act of force majeure. The statute of limitations for imposing a customs sanction under a Customs Code for committing a customs offense is 3 years. Measures to ensure the payment of the tax debt provided for by the Tax Code of Georgia are used to ensure the payment of the imposed customs sanction (e.g. seizure of property, sale of seized property, submission of a collection order to a bank account, etc.).\n \nThe case of customs violation is handled by the customs authority. In case of detection of a customs offense, the authorized person of the customs body shall draw up a customs offense report, which shall be handed over the offender. A customs offense report is a decision of a customs authority to impose a customs sanction on a person for committing an offense. A customs offense report is considered a tax claim. The offender has the right to submit an explanation and / or note to the customs authority, which will be reflected in the customs offense report or attached to it. If, within 30 days of the detection of a customs offense, it is impossible to identify the perpetrator of this act, the customs authority shall make a decision on the transfer of the customs offense goods and / or means of transport to the State.\n \nThe Customs Code defines the measures of liability for the following types of customs offenses:\n \n1. Violation of the deadline for submission of goods / general declaration / declaration of goods or declaration of a means of transport (Article 165)\n \nViolation of the deadline for submission of goods / general declaration / declaration of goods or declaration of a vehicle shall result in a fine of GEL 50 for each delayed full / incomplete day, but not more than GEL 1,000 in total.\n \n2.

National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs\n9.1. The essence of the national commodity nomenclature of foreign trade\n \nThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is an international commodity nomenclature developed by the World Customs Organization to simplify trade procedures and information exchange by harmonizing the description, classification and coding of goods in foreign trade.\n \nHarmonized system (hereinafter the System) is governed by the \"International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\" adopted in June 1983 and entered into force in January 1988.\nAccording to the definition given in the Convention, the \"Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\", hereinafter referred to as the \"Harmonized System\", means the Nomenclature comprising the chapters, the headings and subheadings and their related numerical codes, the Section, Chapter and Subheading Notes and the General Rules for the interpretation of the Harmonized System, set out in the Annex to this Convention;\n \nThe revision, correction and/or additions to the system are carried out by the Harmonized System Committee once in 5 years. Making changes in the harmonized system requires long consideration and analysis and effective implementation.\n \nThe change review cycle begins as soon as a new revision is received. e.g. The 2022 edition was approved in June 2019 (for implementation in 2022), and in the second half of 2019 the revision cycle for the 2027 edition began. Harmonized System (HS) is officially joined by 160 parties: 159 countries (including all EU countries) and the European Union as a union of countries.\n \nIn order to ensure harmonization, the participating countries agreed that each country's national commodity nomenclature should be based on the nomenclature and legal notes of the Harmonized System. The parties have the right to classify the goods beyond the 6-digit commodity code level and add their own legal notices, in accordance with national tariff and statistical needs. Parties often define national customs tariffs at the 8-digit commodity code level. Different countries use a nomenclature consisting of ten or eleven or more digits. If the number of digits in the commodity code exceeds 8 characters, the additional digits are called national subheadings.\n \n212 countries, territorial or economic or customs unions use the system.\n \nThe system is used for the formation of customs tariffs and the collection and processing of statistical data on foreign trade.\n \nCurrently, the governments of countries, international organizations and the private sector are actively using the harmonized system for the development of internal tax and trade strategy of the country, monitoring of controlled goods, determination of rules of origin of goods, price control, protection of quotas, economic analysis and research and other purposes.\n \nHarmonized system includes more than 5,600 commodity groups (headings) structured into 21 sections (Sections I – XXI) and 99 chapters (1-99), of which chapters 98 and 99 are intended for national use, and chapter 77 is reserved for the future possible use in harmonized system.\n \nSections and chapters describe general categories of goods, while heading and subheading provide more precise descriptions of the goods[76].\n\n\n[76] Each group is accompanied by explanatory notes, and the official general rules of interpretation (in 5 volumes, in French and English) have been developed by the World Customs Organization and are published on the website: https://www.wcotradetools.org/en\n\n\nAs a rule, goods are divided into sections and chapters according to the quality of processing or the technological complexity of its manufacture. For example, natural goods such as live animals, vegetables and fruits are classified in I-II section, and products, machinery and vehicles obtained as a result of a complex technological process –in XVI-XVII sections. Also, raw materials are often classified in the initial chapters of sections, and goods obtained from these raw materials - in the next higher chapters. e.g. Silk, cotton, chemical fibers, garments are classified in chapters 50-55 of the XI section (textile materials and textile products), and the following chapters 56-63 include carpets, clothing and other products. A similar principle applies to the sequence of commodity codes within a section. e.g. The original headings 7601-7603 of Chapter 76 include unwrought aluminum, aluminum scrap and powders, and headings 7604-7607 include articles of simple geometrical shape, such as aluminum rods, profiles, wire, sheets, plates, panels, etc. And in the last 7608-7616 headings of the chapter, aluminum pipes, fittings, metal constructions, reservoirs, capacities and other types of aluminum products are classified.\n \nThe commodity nomenclature code consists of 6 digits. The first two digits indicate the harmonized system chapter, the next two digits indicate the heading, and the following two digits- sub-heading. For example, product code 7601 20 refers to Chapter 76 (Aluminum and articles thereof), heading 7601 (Unwrought aluminum) and subheading 7601 20 (Aluminum alloys).\n \nThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) in relation to Georgia has been in force since January 1, 2011.\n \nThe system operating in Georgia is called \"National Commodity Nomenclature of Foreign-Economic Affairs\" (hereinafter SES ESN), which is approved by the order of the Minister of Finance.\n \nThe National Commodity Nomenclature of Foreign Economic Affairs (SES ESN) is prepared on the basis of the 2022 edition of the International Convention \"On the Harmonized System of Commodity Description and Coding System\".\n \nCustoms and tax authorities of Georgia, government regulatory and other agencies use SES ESN for:\n- administration of customs tariff and internal state taxes;\n- determining customs and tax allowances;\n- administration of trade statistics;\n- the control the circulation of goods defined by international agreements and national legislation (eg, such as dual-use and military products, narcotic and psychotropic substances and precursors, prohibited and restricted chemical substances and pesticides, waste, endangered species of wild flora and fauna, ozone-depleting substances and other);\n- the control of compliance with the requirements established by the technical regulations for the admission of various goods to the market; etc.\n \nSES ESN consists of 22 sections and 99 chapters.\n \nThe mentioned nomenclature is detailed at the level of eleven digits, taking into account the specifics of the national economy.\n \nThe following chapters of goods are defined by the national commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs:\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\n\nSection I\n\nLIVE ANIMALS;

Classification rules\n \nThe correct classification of goods is one of the actual issues, since according to the given commodity code, the determination of customs tariff and other taxes and fees, as well as non-tariff measures, prohibitions and restrictions is carried out for specific goods participating in foreign trade. Effective use of customs statistics for the implementation of customs control and foreign trade policy, etc., depends on the accuracy of the classification of goods.\n \nClassification according to the commodity nomenclature means determining the numerical code of this commodity, i.e. classification of goods under a specific commodity heading, subheading and sub-subheading defined for this commodity in the Harmonized System.\n \nGoods can be classified according to various factors, including form, condition, function and composition.\n \nAs an example of classification according to the form of goods, we can consider aluminum: if aluminum is in powder form, it is classified under subheadings 7603 10 and 7603 20; Aluminum in the form of plates, sheets, strips or ribbons is classified under subheadings 7606 11-7606 92; and aluminum in the form of pipes and tubes is classified under subheadings 7608 10-7608 20.\n \nOne of the examples of classification according to constituent materials are tubes and pipes:\n-        tubes and pipes of polymers of ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride and of other plastics are classified under subheadings 3917 21-3917 39;\n-        tubes and pipes of unhardened rubber pipes are classified under subheadings 4009 11-4009 42;\n-        tubes and pipes made of ceramic materials are included in 6906 00 in subheading;\n-        tubes and pipes of cast iron are classified under subheading 7303 00, and of the remaining black metals - under headings -7304-7306 etc.\n \nAn example of a product classified by function is a carbon monoxide (carbon monoxide, СО) detector. If the detector detects and displays the results of gas measurements, it is classified under subheading 9027 10, which includes instruments and apparatus for physical or chemical analysis (for example, polarimeters, refractometers, spectrometers, gas or smoke analyzers), for measuring or checking viscosity, porosity, expansion, surface tension instruments and apparatus, instruments and apparatus for measuring or controlling the quantity of heat, sound or light (including exponents) and microtomes.\n \nIf the detector detects, but does not record or display the results of the analysis of the concentration of the flammable gas, it is classified under subheading 8531 10, which includes protective signaling devices or devices for providing fire signals and similar devices.\n \nThe classification of goods in the National Commodity Nomenclature of Foreign Economic Affairs (SES ESN) is carried out according to the general rules of interpretation of the harmonized system. These are the six rules regulating classification according to the \"Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\", which must be applied consistently when determining the commodity code:\n \nRULE 1\nThe titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for search simplification only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, unless otherwise provided by such texts, according to the provisions of next rules.\n \nRule I clearly indicates that in the classification of goods priority is given to the names of the headings and the notes given for each section and chapter, which indicates that the classification of goods should be started by finding the heading in which the name of the goods is given, and the names of sections, chapters and subchapters should be used to determine the direction of the search.\nIn addition, we must take into account the corresponding notes of sections and chapters. Section notes apply to all chapters that section includes.\nNotes often indicate the exclusion of a particular good from a particular chapter/heading/subheading or the inclusion of a good in a chapter/heading/subheading. The notes also provide definitions of terms and recommendations on classification.\n\n\nRULE 2\na)  Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.\n \nRule 2(a) is used when classifying goods that are not assembled or disassembled, as well as goods that are missing any part or that require some technological treatment in order to obtain a finished form.\nRule 2(a) extends the scope of any heading in which a particular good is included in that heading not only in an assembled but also in an unassembled or unfinished form, provided that the unassembled or unfinished article bears the essential characteristics of the assembled or finished article.\n \nb)  Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partially of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be made according to the principles of Rule 3.\n \nRule 2(b) applies only when the heading describes the material or substance of which the goods are made.\nRule 2(b) explains that if no heading is found in the nomenclature, in the heading of which the name of the goods sought is given, then it is necessary to distinguish the main material from which the goods are made and to find the heading in which the articles made of this material are included.\nRule 2(b) extends any heading relating to a material or substance to include mixtures or compounds of that material or substance with other materials or substances;\n \nRULE 3\nWhen by application of Rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be performed as follows:\n(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. But where each of two or more headings relates to only a part of the materials or substances of a mixture or a composite article, or to a part of the goods presented in a set intended for retail sale, then those headings shall be treated as having equal value in relation to those goods, even if any of them provides a more complete or accurate description of the item\n(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, as far as this criterion is applicable.\n(c) When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or 3 (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\n\n\nAccording to Rule 3(a), in the classification of goods, a heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.\nRule 3 (b) applies if it is not possible to apply Rule 3(a).\nRule 3(b) applies to mixtures, combined goods made up of different materials, goods made up of different components and goods contained in sets intended for retail sale. In all mentioned cases, the goods must be classified according to the material or component that determines their essential characteristic, if the use of such a criterion is applicable.\nAccording to Rule 3(c), if the goods cannot be classified using rules 3(a) or 3(b), ie., when none of the available headings provides a sufficiently precise description of the goods or it is not possible to determine which material or component gives the goods their main characteristics, the product must be classified in the last heading of the ascending order of headings to which the goods can be assigned with equal force.\n\n\nRULE 4\nGoods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above Rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.\n \nRule 4 Applies to goods that cannot be classified according to the rules I-III. It is used if no heading is suitable for the classification of the goods in question and provides for the assignment of such goods to the heading in which the goods most similar to the goods in question are included.\n \nRule 4 is convenient for classifying new products that are not yet reflected in commodity headings.\nWhen classifying goods according to Rule IV, the given item must be compared with similar goods to determine the most similar goods. Similarity can be determined by properties such as materials, functions, form, purpose, manufacturing methods.\n\n\nRULE 5\nIn addition to the foregoing provisions, the following Rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein:\n(a) Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. However, this rule does not apply to a package, which, forming a single whole with the packaged goods, gives the latter an essentially different character.\n(b) Subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this rule, packaging materials and containers supplied with the goods contained in them shall be classified collectively if they are of a type normally used for packing such goods. However, the application of this provision is not mandatory if such packaging materials or containers are clearly suitable for repeated use.\n\n\nRule V(a) applies to the following packaging materials:\n-        shaped or adapted to contain a particular product or set, ie. designed specifically for that particular commodity. Some containers replicate the shape of the commodity that is placed in that container;\n-        Suitable for long-term use, i.e. has the same durability as the goods for which the container is intended; Often, such containers have the function of protecting the product during transportation, handling, etc.;\n-        Presented together with the goods for which they are intended, although these goods may be packed separately for ease of transport;\n-        Sold together with the product.\n \nRule V(b) governs the joint classification of packaging materials and containers other than those covered by Regulation V(a). For that reason, these packaging materials must meet the following conditions:\n-        must be presented together with the goods;\n-        Must be the usual packaging used for the goods in question.\n \nRule V(b) does not apply if it is clear that the packaging material and tar/container can be reused, for example metal containers and reservoirs for the transport of compressed gas.\n \nSuitability for tar reuse can be determined according to the following characteristics:\n-        The integrity of the tar is not violated when it is opened;\n-        According to the technical documentation, it is clear that the tar construction is multiple;\n-        It is clear from the contract between the supplier and the buyer that the packaging is subject to return.\n\n\nRULE 6\nFor legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related Subheading Notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above Rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this Rule, the relative Section and Chapter Notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.\n \nFor the purposes of Rule VI, “one-level subposition” means subpositions with one dash (Level 1) or subpositions with two dashes (Level 2).\n \nAccording to Rule VI, in order to determine the full eleven-digit HS code, we must follow the text of the nomenclature below, from subpositions with one dash to subsubposition with two dashes, then to subsubposition with three dashes, and so on.\n \nOnce a one-dash subheading that provides a more accurate description of the goods is selected, and if that subheading itself is divided, then and only then is the designation of the two-dash subheading considered and one of them selected.\nWhen determining the commodity code of SES ESN:\n-        It is necessary to strictly observe the sequence of interpretation rules;\n-        It is necessary to identify the goods, ie. determining the quality, properties, function, etc. of the goods, which is necessary for the correct application of the general rules of interpretation and subsequent accurate classification, and we should not rely only on the name of the goods;\n-        We must understand the punctuation marks: comma (,), colon (:) and semicolon (;) and hyphen () value in position names. for example:\nIn the description of heading 3701 “Photographic plates and film in the flat, sensitised, unexposed, of any material other than paper, paperboard or textiles; instant print film in the flat, sensitised, unexposed, whether or not in packs”, goods before the first comma \"photographic plates and photographic films in the flat\", carries all the properties listed after the first comma (sensitized, unexposed,) and can be made of “any material other than paper, paperboard or textiles”.\nIt should also be noted that if the goods are classified according to their function in the heading and there is no reference to materials, this means that the goods referred to can be made of any materials.\n\n\nIn the above heading 3701, the punctuation mark \";\" means that after this mark, there is the description of the goods (“instant print film in the flat”) different from the goods given before \";\" and characteristic \"Instant\" does not apply to goods described before the semicolon.\n\n\nA colon \":\" at the end of the heading means that the goods described in that heading or subheading are detailed below at the next level of the heading/subheading. eg: Heading 3701 is detailed as follows:\n\n3701\n\n\t\n\nPhotographic plates and film in the flat, sensitised, unexposed, of any material other than paper, paperboard or textiles; instant print film in the flat, sensitized, unexposed, whether or not in packs:\n\n\n\n\n3701 10 00\n\n\t\n\n– For X-ray:\n\n\n\n\n3701 10 000 01\n\n\t\n\n– –medical, Dental or Veterinary for purposes\n\n\n\n\n3701 10 000 09\n\n\t\n\n– –other\n\n\n\n\n3701 20 000 00\n\n\t\n\n– -Instant print film\n\n\n\n\n3701 30 000 00\n\n\t\n\n– Other plates and film, with any sideexceeding 255 mm\n\n \nThe number of dashes given before the name of the detailed subheading in the commodity nomenclature indicates the depth of detailing and makes it easier to search for specific goods according to the defined algorithm: a one-dash subheading is detailed into two-dash subheadings, a two-dash subheading is detailed into three-dash subheadings, etc. In the sub-headings and sub-subheadings of the nomenclature, in the name of which the word \"other\" is indicated, the goods of the given heading, which are not classified in the previous sub-headings/sub-subheadings, will be included. Any goods for which a clear description is not given in the headings of the preceding sub-headings and sub-sub-headings shall be included in the last \"Other\" given under the relevant sub-headings and sub-sub-headings. e.g. Heading 3503 includes Gelatin (including gelatin in rectangular (including square) sheets, whether or not surface-worked or coloured) and gelatin derivatives; isinglass; other glues of animal origin, excluding casein glues of heading 35.01. The said position is detailed in the following commodity codes:\n3503 00 100 00–Gelatin and its Derivatives\n3503 00 800 00- other\nIn this case, 3503 00 800 00 the commodity code will include isinglass of heading 3503; other glues of animal origin, excluding casein glues of heading 35.01.\n9.3. Preliminary decisions\n \nThe customs authority issues a preliminary decision on the commodity code based on the application of the interested person.\nA preliminary decision on the commodity code is mandatory for the customs authority only in relation to the goods for which the customs formality is carried out, after the entry into force of the above decision.\n \nA preliminary decision is binding on the owner of the decision for execution from the date of delivery of this decision to him.\nA preliminary decision on a commodity code is valid for 3 years after its entry into force.\n \nWhen carrying out separate customs procedures, the holder of the preliminary decision must confirm that the declared goods fully correspond to the goods described in this decision.\n \nIt is not allowed to change the preliminary decision. A preliminary decision will be invalid if it is issued based on incorrect or incomplete information.\n \nA preliminary decision on a commodity code terminates prematurely if:\na) the act of Georgian legislation, on the basis of which the said decision was issued, was changed or cancelled;\nb) The national commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs has been changed, and this change refers to the goods provided for by the above decision.\n \nIn case of premature termination of the validity of the preliminary decision or declaration of invalidity, the validity of this decision may be continued for the performance of the binding contract, which is based on the said decision and which was concluded before its termination or declaration of invalidity.\n \nSuch delay shall not exceed 6 months from the date of early termination or invalidation of the preliminary decision.\n \nIn order for the owner of the preliminary decision to benefit from the postponement, he must apply to the customs authority within 30 days after the earlier termination of the said decision or its declaration as invalid.\n \nThis application must contain information about the quantity of goods for which the extension of the term is requested. The customs authority is authorized to make a decision on the extension of the deadline and notify the owner of the preliminary decision without delay, but no later than 30 days after submitting all the information necessary for making the decision.\n\n\nSubmitting an application for a preliminary decision\nAn interested person, with an electronic application for a preliminary decision on the commodity code (Appendix No. 1-III-01) applies to the Revenue Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia (hereinafter referred to as the Revenue Service) through the website of the Revenue Service (rs.ge).\n \nOne application shall be submitted for one commodity only. In case of failure of the electronic system, the application can also be submitted in material form. The application must contain a list of documents actually submitted for making a preliminary decision.\n \nSubmitting an application for a preliminary decision implies the applicant's consent to the decision and all the data specified in it, including photos and images, proactive publication (posting on electronic resources), taking into account the protection of personal data, information belonging to state, commercial, professional, customs secrets.\n \nWhen referring to the goods in the statement, the commercial name of the goods is written as it is given in the contract or invoice and its description depending on the type of goods. In addition, the description of the goods should include the description of the main characteristics and properties that provide the necessary information for the purposes of classification, for example: the purpose of the goods; the main material from which the goods are made; the function to be performed by the goods; the degree of its processing (if such data determine its properties); brand name established by the manufacturer; model etc.\n \nIssuance of a preliminary decision\nThe application will be reviewed by the customs department and the permanent working group created by the head of the revenue service for the purpose of preparing the draft of the preliminary decision. The composition of the working group is approved by the order of the head of the revenue service. The Customs Department will ensure the preparation and presentation of the issue for discussion at the working group meeting.\n \nThe draft of the preliminary decision on the commodity code for the goods is prepared by the Division of Customs Valuation and Classification of Goods, according to Article 16 of the Regulations of the Customs Department approved by the order of the Head of the Revenue Service No. 2742 dated June 2, 2011, \"On the Approval of the Regulation of Structural Units of the Legal Entity of Public Law - the Revenue Service\".\n \nIf submitted documents and/or information are not sufficient for a preliminary decision, the customs department shall notify the applicant of the existence of a deficiency and the need to eliminate it, and shall set a deadline for the elimination of the deficiency, which shall not exceed 30 days. In this case, the flow of the period for making a preliminary decision is suspended until the defect is eliminated and/or until the specified period expires.\n \nThe customs body is entitled, if necessary, to request the submission of a report issued by a laboratory with appropriate accreditation in Georgia, the related costs of which shall be reimbursed by the applicant.\n \nIn case of non-elimination of the defect within the established period, the Revenue Service is entitled to make a decision to leave the application unconsidered.\n \nThe Revenue Service is authorized to refuse to issue a preliminary decision in the presence of the following grounds:\na) a request for a preliminary decision by a person on the goods for which a preliminary decision has already been issued;\nb) a person's request for a preliminary decision on the goods that have already been declared in the customs procedure (except for the customs warehouse) or in re-export;\nc) motivated decision of the head of the revenue service or a person empowered by him.\n \nThe draft of the preliminary decision is submitted for approval to the head of the revenue service or to a person empowered by him. A preliminary decision on the commodity code is issued in accordance with the form established by Annex No. 1-III-03. If the person acts in accordance with the prior decision, it is not allowed for the controlling/law enforcement authority to make a decision contrary to the prior decision and charge a tax and/or sanction.\n\n\nAppendix No. 1-III-01\n \n\nRevenue Service\n\n\n\n\nstatement\n\nTo make a preliminary decision on thecommodity code\n\n\n\n\nIn thecase of a natural person - the name and surname of the interested person\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn thecase of a legal entity - name, head's name, surname\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAddress of the person\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIdentification number (if any)\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPleaseissue a preliminary decision on the commodity code\n\n\n\n\nCommercial name and description of goods\n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n(signatureof the interested person)\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(day)\n\n\t\n\n(month)\n\n\t\n\n(year)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n(signatureof the interested person)\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(day)\n\n\t\n\n(month)\n\n\t\n\n(year)\n\n \n \nAppendix No. 1-III-03\n\nRevenue Service\n\n\n\n\ninterested person\n\n\t\n\nPreliminary decision on commodity code based on Article 22 of the Customs Code of Georgia\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer of goods\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDocument ssubmitted with the application:\n\n\t\n\ndecisionmaking justification\n\n\n\n\nProduct description:\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCommodity code according to HS\n\n\t\n\nA person authorized to make a decision\n\n\n\n\nDecision number and date\n\n \n\nNo. –––“––––“ ––––––––––––––– 20 year.\n\n \n\nTbilisi\n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\n––––––––––––––––––– ––––––––––––––––\n\n(name surname)(signature)\n\n Place of stamp\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary decision can be appealed in accordance with the procedure established by Chapter IV of the Customs Code of Georgia and Chapter XIV of the Tax Code of Georgia, within 30 days from the delivery of the preliminary decision, through submission an appeal in the system of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia - in written or electronic form(add.: Tbilisi, V.

No. 6) in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation of Georgia. \n\n\n\n Section 10. The Control lists\n10.1. Structure of the dual-use items list\n \nThe list of military products and dual-use goods, whose export, import, transit, related brokerage services and technical assistance are subject to permit control (control lists) is approved by Annexes 1 and 2 of Decree No 394 of 13 June 2014 of the government of Georgia. The list of dual-use goods of Georgia is compatible with the Council Regulation (EC) No 388/2012, setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use goods.\n \nIn order to find products on the list, the knowledge of thematic and structural composition of the list is very important. The control list covers the list of dual-use goods and general notes, which refer to all categories of products of the list.\n \nThe list includes:\n▪ The list of the dual-use items;\n▪ General notes, which apply equally to all categories of products in the list;\nAccording to general notes:\n \nIf a product is designed or modified for military use, reference should be made to the military list;\n \nIf an item on the list is the principal element of any device, and this item can be removed and used for dual purposes, then the control of this item is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the list;\nGoods specified in the control list include both new and used goods;\n \nIn some instances, chemicals are listed by name and CAS number (chemical substance identification number). CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. Nevertheless, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemicals have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may have different CAS numbers.\n \nThe control list covers the following:\nNuclear Technology Note (NTN), which establishes general rules for the control of nuclear technologies alone;\n \nGeneral Technology Notes (GTN) and General Software Notes (GSN) establish general rules for the control of technologies and software of all categories except for nuclear ones;\nAcronyms and abbreviations, which explain acronyms and abbreviations used in the list. For example, AVLIS means Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation, AISI means American Iron and Steel Institute, etc.;\n \nDefinitions of the terminology in the list, which explains definitions of terminology found in the list with double quotation marks. For example, according to the definition given in section Definition of Terms, \"Aircraft\" (1, 6, 7, 9) means a fixed wing, swivel wing, rotary wing (helicopter), tilt rotor or tilt-wing airborne vehicle. In the control list the term \"Aircraft\" is everywhere found with \"double quotation marks\" within the meaning of the section Definition of Terms.\n \nThe numbers in the brackets after the defined term (1, 6, 7, 9) mean that the reference is made to the relevant categories (in this case, reference is made to the categories 1, 6, 7 and 9). It is noteworthy, that the definitions of the terms placed in single quotation marks in the list are given in Technical Notes to the corresponding ECCN numbers (Export Control Classification Number - ECCNs are five-character alpha-numeric designations used to identify dual-use items for export control purposes);\n \nTechnical Notes, which are of great importance in the process of reading the list, since technical notes determine the conditions and characteristics necessary for goods to be included in the control list and specify which goods are controlled and what technologies are used to describe the terms ;\n \nNote, which as a rule, specifies a specific ECCN number or sub-control area, and in most cases, exclude products from the list;\n \nN.B. (Nota bene) - indicates that the definition in the entry is of particular importance and indicates one or more of the recordings in which the specific products should be controlled. Following a specific point, N.B. often indicates ECCN number that contains similar item contained in the specified ECCN and/or provides brief explanations about the product or terms.\n \nExample of how to read Technical Note, Note and N.B. in the list:\n \n1A006 Equipment, specially designed or modified for the disposal of improvised explosive devices\nand components and accessories specially designed for the purpose:\n \nN.B. SEE ALSO MILITARY GOODS CONTROLS.\na. remotely operated vehicles;\nb. 'Disruptors'.\n \nTechnical note:\n'Disruptors' are devices specially designed for the purpose of preventing the operation of an explosive device by projecting a liquid, solid or frangible projectile.\nNote: 1A006 does not control equipment when accompanying its operator.\n \nIn this example:\n- N.B. gives reference to the military list, which means that this equipment can also be controlled by a list of military goods;\n- Technical Note explains the definition of 'disruptors';\n- Note defines the condition in which case the listed device in 1A006 is not controlled.\n \nSome ECCN numbers (e.g. 0C001*, 0B004*, 0B002*, 0B001*, etc.) are marked with asterisks (*), which means that the import, export, transit, related brokerage services and technical assistance of the products classified in this ECCN are subject to permit control, while the permit shall be issued upon a recommendation of the Standing Commission of Military-Technical Issues of the Ministry of Defense of Georgia.\n \nA similar rule of control applies to the circulation of products marked with so-called two asterisks (**), but ECCN numbers are not marked with two asterisks on the list.\n \nAny of the listed items are considered to be marked with two asterisks if the export, import, transit, related brokerage service and technical assistance are provided to/from the country under the United Nations Security Council Resolution sanctions/ embargoes. The principle of two asterisks is the principle of control of the products on the list according to the final destination or consignor country.\n\n\nIt is also possible to export the goods under an export permit that are not included in the list, but its technical and functional characteristics indicate that these subjects can contribute significantly to the design, development or production of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery or military products. The form of control of such products is known as the Catch-All Clause and is focused on not only the lists, but also on the end-user and the end-use of products.\nSome of the items that have the same functional use and technical name found in several entries in the control list (references are made by N.B.s), which is explained by the fact that the control of each specific item is carried out by different non-proliferation and security regimes. Accordingly, the scope of use and technical parameters of these items are different.\n \nExample: \n \n\"Isostatic presses\" are devices that are widely used in mechanical engineering and nuclear and aerodynamic industry to produce high resistance and density details from metal, ceramic and graphite (carbon) powder materials. Isostatic presses are classified in three different ECCN numbers: 2B004, 2B104, and 2B204.\n \nAs we can see, the third numbers of ECCN differ (0, 1, 2), which means that isostatic presses are controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA), the Missile Technologies Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Supply Group (NSG) and their inclusion in the lists is due to the fact that isostatic presses can be used for the production of components necessary for military, missile and nuclear products. According to the specific fields of application, the technical parameters (chamber cavity inside diameter, controlled thermal environment and working pressure) for isostatic presses included in different ECCNs may vary.\n \nThe types of products on the list subject to control are classified under ECCN numbers. The knowledge of their structure will be very helpful in the process of identification and classification of goods.\nThe list of dual-use items consists of 10 categories of products. Products are categorized in terms of use and technical and functional purposes. Digits from 0 to 9 are indicative of each category:\n \nCategory 0 Nuclear materials, facilities and equipment;\nCategory 1 Special materials and related equipment;\nCategory 2 Processing of materials;\nCategory 3 Electronics;\nCategory 4 Computers;\nCategory 5 Telecommunications and \"information security\";\nCategory 6 Sensors and lasers;\nCategory 7 Navigation and avionics;\nCategory 8 Marine;\nCategory 9 Aerospace and propulsion.\n \nThe first numeric symbol of ECCN in the control list points to the category (e.g.: 1C111).\nEach category includes groups formed according to technical application identified by alphabet letters\nA, B, C, D, E:\n \nA. Systems, equipment, components;\nB. Testing, inspection and production equipment;\nC. Materials;\nD. Software;\nE. Technologies.\n \nIn the control list, the second alphabetic symbol of ECCN indicates the group (e.g.: 1C111).\nA common control list of dual-use items includes products, technologies and software listed in nonproliferation and security regimes, which are: Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), Australia Group (AG), Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) ) and The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC)\n \nIn the control list, the third numeric symbol of ECCN points to the relevant nonproliferation and security regime in the following order:\n \n0 - Wassenaar Arrangement (WA);\n1 - Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR);\n2 - Nuglear Suppliers Group (NSG);\n3 - Australia Group (AG);\n4 - Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n \nIf the third numeric symbol of ECCN is \"0\", it means that items under this ECCN are listed in WA dual-use items control list (e.g.: 1A001-1A008, 1B001-1B003, 1C001-1C012 etc.).\nIf the third numeric symbol of ECCN is \"1\", it means that items under this ECCN are listed in MTCR second-category control list, implying that they can be used not only in missile technologies (e.g.: 1A102, 1B102, 1B115-1B119 , 1C101-1C111, 1C116-1C118 etc).\nIf the third numeric symbol of ECCN is \"2\", it means that items under this ECCN are listed in Annex 2 of NSG guidelines (INFCIRC/254, Part 2), and are dual-use goods and technologies related to the nuclear field that can be used for civil purposes, as well as nuclear fuel cycles and other nuclear processes (1A202-1A227, 1B201-1B233, 1C202-1C240).\n \nIf the third numeric symbol of ECCN is \"3\" or \"4\", it means that items under this ECCN are listed according to AG or CWC and are related to manufacturing chemical or biological weapons (e.g.: 1C350, 1C351-1C354, 1C450 etc .).\n \nFor example: under ECCN 1C111, propellants and constituent chemicals for propellants are controlled. Let's try to read this ECCN symbol by symbol:\n- The first numeric symbol \"1\" implies that this item is included in the first category and is a special material; - The second alphabetic symbol \"C\" implies that this item is included in the group of materials;\n- The third numeric symbol \"1\" implies that the item control is carried out in accordance with the MTCR, and these items can be used for the creation of missiles;\n- The fourth and the fifth symbols \"11\" point to relevant numerations in the list.\n10.2. Search for an item in the control list\nItems in the control list can be searched using several methods, such as:\n\n\n10.2.1. Search by type of product and its industrial and technical purpose.\nThe use of this method requires relatively deep knowledge and understanding of the control list and is practiced by specialists and experts authorized to identify such items and issue permits for their transfer.\n \nWe looked at the structure of the control list and saw that dual-use items are classified by five-digit codes (ECCNs), and each character of this code indicates a product category, group, and non-proliferation regime. As a result of the analysis of technical documentation and other information for a specific product, you can find the products you are looking for in the list in connection with the general technical name of the product, production and technical purpose, scope, functionality, technical parameters and, other data.\n \nNow, let us discuss an example according to a specific contract:\nExporter: Georgian company;\nImporter: Azerbaijani company;\nGoods according to the contract: Wine production equipment and auxiliary equipment;\nGoods according to the invoice: Tank (reservoir), brand ENOTANK[77];\nManufacturer of the goods: ALBRIGI TECHNOLOGIES, ITALY;\nOpen source: http://www.albrigi.com/ru/product/SP.40/Enotank\nCommodity HS code: 7309 00 590 00.\nIdentification process:\n- The reservoir is used in the process of production, storage, mixing, etc. of any substance (in this case of wine). In addition, according to the manufacturer's specifications, Albrigi's reservoirs are also used in the chemical industry. That means that, according to categories, the product can be classified under Category 2 - Material Processing;\n- According to the industrial/technical use, a reservoir is a manufacturing equipment or component of this device, through which we produce materials/substances (in this case wine), so it belongs to group B (Test, Inspection and Production Equipment);\n- The manufacturer's website says that Albrigi's reservoirs are also used in chemical industries. Equipment and chemicals that can be used to obtain agents for chemical weapons are controlled by an Australia Group regime, indicating a third numerical symbol of ECCN number - 3.\n- Thus, we have received the first three characters of the ECCN number of the control list: 2B3.\nIf we search for ECCN numbers on the control list that starts with 2B3, we will see that there are only three entries: 2B350, 2B351 and 2B352, and the product search area will be significantly reduced. Since our product is related to the chemical industry, it is most likely that what we have to look for is the ECCN 2B350 (chemical manufacturing facilities, equipment and components) and here is the result: On the control list, reservoirs used in the chemical industry are classified under point \"c\" of ECCN 2B350:\n- 2B350.c - Storage tanks, containers or receivers with a total internal (geometric) volume larger than 0.1 m3 (100 liters), where all surfaces that come in direct contact with the chemical(s) processed or contained are made of any of the following materials:\n [77] http://www.albrigi.com/ru/product/SP.40/Enotank\n\n\n1. Alloys with more than 25% of nickel and 20% of chromium by weight;\n2. Fluorine polymers (polymeric or elastomeric materials with more than 35% of fluorine by weight);\n\n\n1. Alloys with more than 25% of nickel and 20% of chromium by weight;\n2. Fluorine polymers (polymeric or elastomeric materials with more than 35% of fluorine by weight);\n3. Glass (including vitrified or enameled coatings or glass lining);\n4. Nickel or alloys with more than 40% of nickel by weight;\n5. Tantalum or tantalum alloys;\n6. Titanium or titanium alloys;\n7. Zirconium or zirconium alloys; or\n8. Niobium (columbium) or niobium alloys;\n \n \nTo complete the identification process, we have to compare parameters given in ECCN number 2B350.c to the technical specifications of an ENOTANK reservoir:\n \nENOTANK capacity is 300 liters, the inner surface is coated in a mirror way and is not deposited. The material of which ENOTANK is produced is AISI 304/L alloy with the following chemical composition:\nAlloy     C         Si         Mn        P≤         S≤    Cr    Mo     Ni    Other\n 304L  ≤0.03   ≤ 0.75    ≤2.00     0.045    0.03   18-  20 -   8-12\nAccording to 2B350.c.1, the reservoir is controlled if the alloy under which it is manufactured, contains more than 25% of nickel and more than 20% of chromium. Alloy AISI 304/L contains 8-12% of nickel and 18-20% of chromium. Thus, the reservoir ENOTANK is not a dual-use product.\n \n10.2.2. Keyword search methods on the control list\n\n\nThe list of dual-use goods is approved by the Ordinance No. 394 of the government of Georgia of 13 June 2014 and available to interested persons on official websites of various agencies[78];\n \n[78] https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/2372203?publication=0\nEach product, machinery, systems, equipment, components, chemical and biological materials, etc. are included in the list in a way of single commonly recognized and specific technical name and not synonyms (e.g. \"pump\", \"compressor\", \"pressure sensors\" etc.);\n \nThe general technical names commonly used in the list to mark a group of products with the same properties are the main common features of this group, such as \"ceramic base materials\", \"liquids and lubricants\", \"magnetic metals\", \"optical materials \", etc.\n \nIn some instances, chemicals are listed by name and CAS number (US Chemical Abstracts Service) which is an individual registry number for all chemicals (e.g. sulfur monochloride (10025-67-9).\n \nNote: According to general notes of the control list, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers, because some forms of the listed chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different CAS numbers.\n \nSometimes the name of the product is indicated in Latin letters on the control list (e.g. bacteria in 1C351.c, Bacillus anthracis, Chlamydia psittaci, etc.).\n \nGiven the abovementioned, you can find products on the control list using keywords: Write the text in the text search field without a suffix (e.g. \"pump\", \"valve\", \"reservoir\", \"salmonella\", \"zirconium\", \"aluminum \", \"uranium\", \"10025-67-9\" etc.) and search for a product in the entire text.\n \nIt is noteworthy that products with similar technical denominations and functions are often listed on the list several times under different categories, groups or non-proliferation regimes, and therefore, we can find the same entry several times. In this case, we have to choose the products that are closely related to our products.\n \n10.3. How to use the correlation list\nWith the aim of simplifying the use of dual-use items control list and simplifying the identification of goods, the Customs Department of Georgia has developed a so-called correlation table, in which each item involved in the control list, is defined by an eleven-digit code of the national commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs (hereinafter Harmonized System Commodity Code or HS commodity code).\n \nThe correlation table is approved by the order of Minister of Finance of Georgia No 292 of 30 September 2014. The table comprises 4 columns:\n- The first column contains the commodity codes at the eleven-digit levels;\n- In the second column, if this HS code does not belong to a particular item, the eleven-digit code name is given in the name of the heading (4-digit level HS commodity code), subheading (6-digit level HS commodity code) and sub-subheading (9-digit level HS commodity code) names of the code that are separated by the corresponding hyphen (for example, the following entries are made for HS commodity code 2844 10 100: - - natural uranium: - - - unwrought; waste and scrap);\n- The third column contains the ECCN number, the Latin symbol denoting the paragraph and the number indicating the subsection (e.g. 1C450.a.7). The E, D symbol is indicated for products which may be subject to control due to transmission of technologies or software;\n- The fourth column indicates the name and description of the product according to the ECCN, paragraph and subsection (e.g. toxic chemicals and toxic chemicals precursors such as: Chloropicrin: Trichloronitromethane (76-06-2)[79].\n \n[79] Note: It is noteworthy that the fourth column of the correlation table does not include \"Notes\", \"Technical Notes\" and \"NB\" in which the condition is often decisive for the identification of goods. Therefore, we need to get full text of the description defined for the products classified in a particular ECCN on the control list. For example, the correlation table does not contain \"Note 3\" for Trichloronitromethane, according to which 1C450 does not control chemical mixtures in which no individually specified chemical constitutes more than 1 % by the weight of the mixture\n\n\nOne HS commodity code may be repeated several times in the table, which is due to the fact that the products with the same technical description may be found in the control list in different ECCN numbers or that various products or components of different denominations may be classified under the same HS code.\n \nFor example, HS code 7219 32 100 00 (corrosion-resistant flat-rolled stainless steel) corresponds to the following entries in the control list: ECCN 1C116 and ECCN 1C216 for maraging steel, ECCN 1C118 for titanium-stabilized duplex stainless steel and ECCN 1A005 for components for body armor.\n \nFor a specific ECCN number, a table may contain a number of HS codes derived from the specificity of the classification under the commodity nomenclature that the goods may be attributable under two or more headings.\n For example, in the control list, titanium-stabilized duplex stainless steel under ECCN 1C118 corresponds to the following entries in the correlation table: 7219 13 100 00, 7219 14 100 00, 7219 23 000 00, 7219 24 000 00, 7219 32 100 00 and 7219 35 100 00.\nWhile using the correlation table, we must remember the following:\n- If the product is classified under the HS code in the correlation table, this does not always mean that it is a dual-use item;\n- If a particular HS commodity code cannot be found in the correlation table, this does not always mean that it is not a dual-use item;\n- The classification of items on the basis of the control list shall be carried out by determining the conformity of the technical characteristics of these goods with the technical characteristics indicated in the list and according to the explanations, technical specifications and comments indicated for this particular product, not by the commodity HS code.\nFor the implementation of customs procedures, it is very important to accurately determine the HS code of the national commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs for specific goods.\nIf we know which commodity HS code a particular product is classified under, we can find the goods in the control list using the correlation table[80]:\n [80] https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/2520245?publication=0\n\n\nExample 1. Reservoir\n \nIf the goods to be exported are black metal tanks for liquids, with volume less than 100,000 liters, the tank will be classified within the HS code 7309 00 590 00.\nIn the search field of the correlation table (or in the filter of the first column), enter the HS code at the eleven-digit level 7309 00 590 00, exactly in the format given in the SES ESN, and find the corresponding entry:\n\n\n\n7309 00 590 00\n\n\t\n\nReservoirs, tanks, vats and similar containers for any material (other than compressed or liquefied gas),of iron or steel, of a capacity exceeding 300 liters, whether or not lined or heat insulated, but not fitted with mechanical or thermal equipment.:– for liquids – of another capacity — — not exceeding 100 000 liters \n\n\t\n\n2B350c\n\n\t\n\nChemical manufacturing facilities, equipment and components, as follows: \n\nStorage tanks, containers or receivers with a total internal (geometric) volume more than 0,1 m 3 (100liters) where all surfaces that come in direct contact with the chemical(s)being processed or contained are made of any of the following materials: \n\n1.

Titanium or titanium alloys; \n\n7. Zirconium or zirconium alloys; or \n\n8. Niobium (columbium) or niobiumalloys; \n\nAs a result, we see that all those products that are classified or can be classified by the declarant under the HS code 7309 00 590 00 are defined by points \"a\" and \"c\" of ECCN 2B350 as reactor vessels and tanks for the chemical industry\n \nThe next step is to check full information and explanations (Notes, Technical Notes and N.B) of points \"a\" and \"c\" of ECCN 2B350 on the control list (Appendix 2 of Ordinance No 394 of the government of Georgia of 13 June 2014) and start the process of identification.\n \nExample 2: VALVE\n \nThe valves, with some exceptions, are classified under heading 8481, while the shut-off valves, except for cast iron and steel valves – are under the 8481 80 790 00 HS code.\n \nIn order to find our product in the correlation list, we have to write 8481 80 790 00 HS code in the search field of the table (or filter of the first column of the table) and look for the relevant entries:\n \n \n\n8481 80 790 00\n\n\t\n\nTaps, cocks, valves and similar appliances, for pipes, boiler shells, tanks, vats or the like, including pressure-reducing valves and thermostatically controlled valves:– other appliances:– – – – shut-off valves:— — — — — other \n\n\t\n\n2A226\n\n\t\n\nValves having all of the following characteristics: \n\na.

Use of open sources and use of special programs\n \nThe information needed to identify goods can be obtained from various sources and methods:\n- Technical documentation (technical passport, MSDS, blueprints, charts, test protocols). The technical documentation must be perfect and the parameters in it are to be comparable with the characteristics of the same product in the control list;\n- The manufacturer's website where the technical documentation, general descriptions of goods and the fields of use can be found (although here have been cases, when the manufacturer changed the information posted on the website, concealing the strategic importance of the product). Occasionally, enterprises place information on the compliance of their products with the control lists.[81]\n[81] https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Legal_Docs/en/hts-eccn-ccats-2019-07.pdf\n- Correspondence with manufacturers (the personal page of an enterprise often has the contact information and in practice we often ask about the parameters of particular items);\n- Open sources (e.g. information provided by online stores about the goods, as well as identical and similar goods, information on metal alloys and chemical substances);\n- The standards, which are applied when manufacturing the goods. Such standards are the International Standardization Organization Standards (ISO), CIS Regional (GOST), Germany (DIN), USA (ASTM) and other standards;\n- Information on the product or packaging (e.g. stamps and marking, information boards on the devices, chemical composition of substances on the first or secondary packaging, etc.);\n- The invoice (pro-forma invoice). Manufacturers often indicate in the invoice, which regulations are applied to particular goods. For example:\n\n\nIt should also be noted that introduction of such practices in all countries as well as the compliance of its products to the control lists and on the website, would somewhat simplify and facilitate the implementation of export control and customs procedures;\n- Laboratory Research and Expertise - Accredited Laboratories and National Bureau of Experts operate in Georgia, enabling to draw certified conclusions on the technical parameters of some goods according to the legislation[82].\n\n\n[82] http://gac.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&sec_id=2,\n http://expertiza.gov.ge/page.html?page=acts&item=1081\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch engine for UN Security Council resolutions[83]\n[83] http://unscr.com/\n\n\nThis is an unofficial free service designed for those who need to search for UN Security Council resolutions in their work, especially for politicans, specialists and researchers in the field of international law and international politics, as well as for customs officials who are directly related to their professional activities and play a special role in the implementation of the UN non-proliferation measures.\nIn the specified system, a search is possible by document number, document acceptance year, country and search word. For example, if we enter 2015 in the field «Year» and select the country «Iran» in the field «Topic», the system will display information about Resolution 2231 (2015) of the Security Council, related documents and full text[84].\n \n[84] Important information for the implementation of UNSCR resolutions is given on the website: https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list\n\n\nWisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control[85]\n\n\n[85] https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list\n\n\n.It is a non-profit private organization that conducts research and public awareness to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery.\n \nIran Watch[86]\n\n\n[86] http://www.iranwatch.org\n\n\nIran Watch is a website that investigates and publicizes Iran's missile and nuclear programs, organizations, individuals and legal entities involved in these programs, the so-called \"suppliers\", as well as international measures, which are directed against the progress of the mentioned program.\n \nThe Risk Report[87]\n\n\n[87] http://www.riskreport.org\n   http://www.wisconsinproject.org/risk-report/\n\n\nThis is a database used to control the trade in strategic goods, which contains profiles of thousands of organizations involved in proliferation of WMD around the world.\nThe databases contain information on persons sanctioned by the US, UN, EU, and other countries, US export control regulations, EU control lists, guidelines for multilateral export control regimes, descriptions of goods controlled by these regimes, and analysis of various suspicious programs and additional reference materials. \nGovernment officials from licensing authorities, customs, law enforcement, and intelligence services in approximately 40 countries around the world rely on risk report databases to make strategic decisions.\nWith the help of the US State Department, the officials of the Customs Service of Georgia have also received access to the mentioned databases, who are simultaneously sent email notifications from the program office about updating the account, imposing new financial and trade sanctions, and research.\n \nEU Sanctions Map[88]\n\n\n[88] https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main\n\n\nThe EU sanctions map includes EU and UN sanctions, lists of sanctioned persons, sanctions information tools, websites of competent authorities, a and search engine for restrictive measures imposed on goods in accordance with the Commodity Code.\n \nOn the main page, the table contains a list of countries, the type of sanctions imposed on each country, the author and types of sanctions, lists of individuals and legal entities and organizations, legal acts, and guidelines.\n \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions search page (Sanctions List Search)[89]\n\n\n[89] https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/\nThis is a free tool created by OFAC to help the public side comply with the sanctions program rules. It is intended for individual users seeking potential compliance with OFAC's sanctions lists.\nDefinition of Internal Compliance Program (ICP)\nInternational experience shows that an efficient national export control system can be implemented only by joint efforts of the state and business society.\n \nThe role of the state in the area of control over the circulation of strategic goods is to develop an efficient export control policy and to meet obligations under non-proliferation regimes, which is reflected in the implementation and observance of international agreements and treaties.\n \nThe duty of the industry is to pursue the state export control policy. In order to ensure that companies are able to comply with the requirements of national legislation and export control rules regarding the non-proliferation of WMD, it is desirable that they develop and implement so-called internal compliance systems (internal control system, internal compliance program).\n \nThe following obligations of the permit holder are specified in Paragraph 3 of Article 14 of the law of Georgia on control of military and dual-use items:\n \nThe permit holder shall comply with the permit conditions set forth in the Georgian legislation by:\n \na) Immediately informing the licensing authority on any changes made to the documents submitted for obtaining the permit;\nb) Putting in place an internal control system that ensures compliance with the conditions of the permit;\nc) Maintaining an information database that will allow to immediately report on the fulfillment of the permit conditions upon the request of the licensing authority;\nd) Facilitating control measures for the licensing authority as set forth by the legislation of Georgia.\n \nPrecise explanation of the rules for creating and operating the internal compliance system is not determined by the legislation of Georgia. Therefore, the following explanations and recommendations will do companies good service in developing and implementing their own internal compliance systems.\n \nThe Internal Compliance Program (ICP) is a kind of agreement whereby companies guarantee that they will only make legal transactions and observe the regulations adopted by the state and the export policy declared by the company.\n \nThe ICP includes a set of procedures and measures to be taken by an organization to ensure compliance with export control rules. Authorized employees must follow the rules before sending goods to another country (for example, screening of the buyer and end-user of the product etc.)\n \nThere are many models of ICPs. One of the most efficient systems has been developed by the German company Leybold in the early 1990s. This was the period when the German government began to reassess the existing export control system, and ICP created by Leybold is the best example of how the company is responsible for protecting Germany's strict export control requirements, often even at the expense of rejecting profitable transactions.\n \nICP system should include the following main activities:\n \n-        Establishment of regular contacts and cooperation with agencies/authorities issuing exporting licenses/permits;\n-        Continuous receipt of information on changes and updates made to legislative and sub-legal regulations governing export control;\n-        Centralization of export-related issues and problems;\n-        Standardization of procedures;\n-        Provision of advance notice and verification of all orders and requests;\n-        Creation of a package of consistent and comprehensive documentation on all sensitive export operations; and\n-        Organization of training for all employees who are directly or indirectly involved in export control.\n \nOne of the main objectives of the ICP is to select a partner correctly and prevent suspicious transactions with suspicious companies. For this purpose, it is first and foremost necessary to \"familiarize with\" and carefully study the buyers of sensitive products. To analyze each potential transaction, the company may use a questionnaire, which may contain the following items to select a partner:\n \n-        How transparent is the identity of the buyers or end-users?\n-        Is there a mediator?\n-        Are client data included in the list of persons sanctioned by the UN Security Council or the Government and involved in the illegal trade in strategic goods or in a nuclear program of any country?\n-        Does the client want or not or does he/she intend or not to provide information on the final use of the products to be reviewed;\n-        Whether the specific products are relevant to the scope of the buyer's business;\n-        Is the product consistent with the technical development of the destination country?\n-        What are the types of payment: Is the buyer willing to pay a large amount in cash, and does this correspond to his/her financial capabilities? Or does he/she offer an unusually profitable conditions to the vendor?\n-        What is the buyer's business experience (for example, company history)?\n-        Does the client know what products he wants to buy, its parameters and capabilities?\n-        Is the product related to the military industry?\n-        Does the client avoid or vaguely answer the question on whether the product is intended for internal use, export or re-export?\n-        Have nonproliferation obligations of recipient countries been verified?\n-        Was it emphasized that products are subject to permit control or intended for military purposes?\n-        Is the shipping company listed as a recipient or end-user?\n-        Is the supply chain suspicious?\n-        Does the buyer require unusual or inappropriate labeling or overloading?\n-        Does the customer refuse to cooperate (no fixtures, no instructions, no maintenance etc.).\n \nTo successfully implement an ECP, internal export control hierarchy needs to first and foremost be created. A group of export control officers must be formed or an authorized employee must be designated (according to the scope of the company or enterprise) with functions that include:\n-        Evaluation of each specific trade operation (goods, technology, software) so that the export is fully compliant with export control legislation;\n-        Product identification against control lists;\n-        Collaboration with government authorities responsible for issuance of permits and enforcement;\n-        Legal consulting;\n-        Personnel training or organization of trainings, etc.\n \nIn addition,\n-        A senior official of a company, such as the chief executive officer or president/DG, should always act as an export control officer and be responsible for all export operations;\n-        None of the products should be sent from the company until all internal compliance procedures are completed with duly signed documents and a permit issued by the state body;\n-        All employees of the company should be informed on their obligation to pursue the export policy established by the organization. An opinion of each employee and analysis of export operations is of great importance for decision-making on transactions;\n-        Company employees must regularly attend courses and seminars, and also study not only export control rules, but also technical aspects of the product and its strategic use, the risk of misusing these products, identifying illegal and suspicious transactions, etc.;\n-        In addition, employees should be well aware of the fact that any misconduct and personal negligence are punishable, and they will be charged for violating these rules;\n-        The unit/division/department responsible for export control should have constant communication with officials of the relevant state bodies in order to always be informed of any amendments;\n-        Assessment of the company's internal compliance program should regularly be carried out in order to ensure compliance with policy procedures and high standards;\n-        If the company has problems with the implementation of the export control policy, it should contact the state export control authorities or other companies to exchange experience;\n-        A company must create its own internal database about prohibited persons, companies and countries. These databases should include any country and international lists. In addition, the Company must ensure that it does not violate any rules, conventions, treaties or requirements of international organizations regarding the non-proliferation of WMD. To this end, the company must develop a database on the international legal framework governing international trade in dual-use goods.\nAn internal compliance system should develop procedures for continuous innovations and improvement. The system must be constantly updated and adapted in accordance with government legislation and changes in the company's policy. Unfortunately, despite the existence of a databases of suspicious companies and illegal transactions, as well as numerous databases that support the identification of strategic goods, the private sector and government agencies often do not have access to such databases.\nMarket Analysis and Industry Mapping\n \nAfter independence, Georgia found itself on a very difficult path of state formation. This was a period of intense internal or external processes that had a negative impact on the development of the country's economy. The country's enterprises have almost disappeared, the scientific sphere and the education system were in poor condition, and the country became almost completely dependent on imports.\n \nAt present, compared to the agricultural sector, Georgia is currently developing at a slow pace in the fields of mechanical engineering, chemical industry and other fields of science and research.\n \nTherefore, it should be noted that there are only a few enterprises in the country that produce (and/or trade) strategic goods or whose activities are related to dual-use items and technologies, and that the turnover of dual-use items is low compared to developed countries.\n \nThe quantitative statistics on permits issued by the Revenue Service over the past three years looks like as follows:\n\nType of the permit\n\n\t\n\nQuantity of permits issued in 2020-2023\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\t\n\n2021\n\n\t\n\n2022\n\n\t\n\nQ2 2023\n\n\n\n\nExport permit on DUG\n\n\t\n\n141\n\n\t\n\n139\n\n\t\n\n135\n\n\t\n\n \n\n \n\n112\n\n\n\n\nImport permit on DUG\n\n\t\n\n21\n\n\t\n\n7\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nTransit permit on DUG\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\t\n\n6\n\n\t\n\n14\n\n\t\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nPermit on brokering service\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nPermit of technical assistance\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL:\n\n\t\n\n166\n\n\t\n\n152\n\n\t\n\n153\n\n\t\n\n124\n\n \nThe major number of permits is issued on the:\n \nExport of sodium cyanide\nExport of explosive substances, electric detonators, detonating cords\nExport of boron carbide enriched by boron-10, boric acid\nExport of network devices\nImport of explosive substances, electric detonators, detonating cords\nTransit of natural uranium concentrate\n \nYou can find information about Georgian companies whose activities are related to dual-use products / technologies at the following websites:\n \nGEONITRO LTD\nhttp://www.geo-nitro.ge/en/\n RUSTAVIS AZOTI LLC\nhttps://rustaviazot.ge/\n \nNATIONAL CENTER OF HIGH TECHNOLOGIES\nhttp://www.geoisotopes.com/ka/bori-ge\n \nRMG GOLD LLC\nhttp://www.richmetalsgroup.com/\n \nNITRO ALTEX LLC\nhttp://nitroaltex.ge/ka/chven-shesakheb\n \nAERO STRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES CYCLONE JSC\nhttp://www.atccomposite.com/\n \nRICHARD LUGAR RESEARCH CENTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH http://ncdc.ge/Pages/User/LetterContent.aspx?ID=2fd8140d-956a-45a0-bc6c-63f9fdd63346\n \nSTATE MILITARY SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL CENTER “DELTA” \nhttp://www.delta.gov.ge/\n \nERC-DISTRIBUTION GEORGIA\nhttps://erc-distribution.com/\nAt the same time, Georgia’s scientific and research institutes are capable of working in a number of sensitive technology areas that may be subject to controls. For example, Georgia’s active biotechnology community should be aware of the laws that might govern their work with international partners.\nThese communities and institutions are systematically improving technical bases, introducing new technologies, expanding production and establishing themselves on the international market.\n\n\nSection 11. Case Studies\nFast Reacting Ion-Exchange Resins \nHS codes: 3914 00 000 00\n                3824 99 150 00\n \nEquipment and components, specially designed or prepared for ion-exchange separation process, as follows:\n \n0B001.f Fast reacting ion-exchange resins, pellicular or porous macro-reticulated resins in which the active chemical exchange groups are limited to a coating on the surface of an inactive porous support structure, and other composite structures in any suitable form, including particles or fibres, with diameters of 0,2 mm or less, resistant to concentrated hydrochloric acid and designed to have an exchange rate half-time of less than 10 s and capable of operating at temperatures in the range of 373 K (100Co) to 473 K (200Co);\nIon exchange resin or ion exchange polymer is the resin or polymer that creates an environment for the ion exchange process. It is an insoluble (stable) matrix, usually in the form of white or yellow microspheres about 0.005 - 1.43 mm in size, made from an organic polymer substrate (however, the ion exchange resin may be in the form of particles, fibers or a membrane with an irregular surface).\n \nSpherules are usually porous, so they have a large surface area. Ions are captured on the surface of the spherules and inside it, at the expense of the release of other ions, which is why this process is called ion exchange. The ion exchange process is also called ion chromatography, and ion exchange resins are often referred to as chromatography resins. There are several types of ion exchange resins. Most commercial resins are made from polystyrene sulfonate.\n \nIon exchange resins are used:\n \nTo soften hard water by replacing magnesium and calcium ions with sodium ions; filter water, in particular, remove ions of toxic and hazardous metals (copper, lead, cadmium), replacing them with safer sodium and potassium ions; in the production of fruit juices, remove bitter taste components, which makes it possible to make juices from less tasty fruits; in sugar production for decolorization and clarification of sugar syrups; in the production of pharmaceuticals and medicines, etc.\nIon exchange processes are used to separate and purify metals, including the separation of uranium from plutonium and other actinides, including thorium.\n \nOne example of such processes is the so-called PUREX (plutonium-uranium recovery process). This is a process in which plutonium and uranium are separated from spent nuclear reactor fuel elements and waste is removed, after which the plutonium and uranium are suitable for the production of nuclear energy materials such as fuel for reactors and nuclear weapons.\n \nIon exchange resins are also an important component of underground uranium mining. Uranium-containing water with a U3O8 content of 0.05% is taken from the well, which is filtered through an ion-exchange resin.\nDuring the ion exchange process, the resin spherules attract uranium ions from the solution.\n \nNext, the uranium-containing resin is transported to a processing plant, where U3O8 is separated from the resin beads and a yellow powder of uranium concentrate is obtained.\n \nOne of the main strategic purposes of ion exchange resins is the use of uranium enrichment in the ion exchange process.\n \nEnrichment of uranium in the ion-exchange process is achieved by adsorption/desorption of uranium on a special highly reactive resin or adsorbent. A solution of uranium and hydrochloric acid and other chemical reagents are passed through cylindrical enrichment columns containing dense layers of adsorbent.\n \nAccordingly, the main characteristics of the resins intended for the ion exchange process of uranium enrichment are high chemical exchange rate (1000 times higher than the exchange rate of commercially available resins), stability to a certain temperature (100°C-200°C) and pressure, resistance to high acidity, property, withstand repeated processing and uniform particle size (less than 0.2 mm).\n \nAtomic grade resin spherules are exceptionally strong and pure, with a minimum content of metals, chlorides and organic impurities.\n \nIon exchange resin is a safe material and is not hazardous to health prior to use. When in contact with solutions, the resins become impregnated with the chemicals present in the solution, which can cause skin damage upon contact.\n \nIon exchange resins are transported in small packages of up to 1 kg. High quality products are sealed in glass bottles and shipped in hard cardboard boxes.\n \nMoist resin can be placed in polyethylene bags. Packages are placed in dense cardboard cylinders, closed and affixed with the appropriate label. The drums, which usually contain about 0.2 m3 (160 kg) of resin, are mounted on a wooden stand.\nThe photo shows the yellow powder of uranium concentrate obtained as a result of the ion exchange process.\nAs we have already mentioned, ion exchange resins are widely used for water filtration and softening, in medicine, for the separation of chemical mixtures and compounds, in the biodiesel filtration process, etc.\nAll of the above processes use ion exchange resins of appropriate quality and parameters, and it is very rare to find resins with parameters defined by the control list.\nCompanies producing ion exchange resins must indicate in the technical documentation the industry or technological process for which ion exchange resin of a specific quality/name/brand is intended.\n \nThe technical documentation also indicates the type of product, particle size, temperature range, acid resistance, composition, etc., which are the necessary parameters for documentary identification.\n \ne.g. Purolite NRW5010 Ion Exchange Resin manufactured by Purolite, on the data sheet indicates that the product is nuclear grade.\n\n\nMetal Powders\n1C111 Rocket propellants and propellant chemicals, other than those specified in 1C011, as follows:\na. Propelling substances:\n1. Spherical or spheroidal aluminum powder in particle size of less than 200 µm and aluminum content of 97% by weight or more, if at least 10% of the total weight is made up of particles of less than 63 µm, according to ISO 2591- 1:1988 or national equivalents; Technical Note: A particle size of 63 µm (ISO R-565) corresponds to 250 mesh (Tyler) or 230 mesh (ASTM standard E-11).\n2. Metal powders, other than those specified in the military items control list, spherical, pulverized, spheroidal, flake, or precipitated, with a particle size of less than 60 µm, consisting of 97% or more by weight of any of the following:\na. zirconium;\nb. beryllium;\nc. magnesium; or\nd. Alloys of the metals specified in a to c above.\nb. Boron with a purity of 85% or higher or metallic powders of boron alloys with a purity of 85% or higher, if not less than 90% of the total number of particles has a particle size of 60 µm or less;\n1. Boron of 85% or higher purity by weight;\n2. Boron alloys with a boron content of 85% or more by weight.\n \nMetal Powders\nECCNs 1C011, 1C111\nSpherical and spheroidal aluminum powder (CAS 7429-90-5) HS 7603 10;\nZirconium (CAS 7440-67-7) powder HS 8109 21, 8109 29;\nBeryllium (CAS 7440-41-7) powder HS 8112 12, 8112 13;\nMagnesium powder (CAS 7440-41-7) (HS 8104 11, 8104 19, 8104 30);\nMetallic powder of boron (CAS 7440-42-8) and boron alloys (HS 2804 50 100 00, 2849 90 100 00);\n\n\nApplications: Aluminum, beryllium, boron, magnesium and zirconium powders with a particle size of 60 x 10–6 m (60 microns) are used to improve the properties of solid and liquid rocket propellants. For example, aluminum powder, as an additive, makes up 5-20% of the mass of solid fuel. The combustion of aluminum raises the combustion temperature of such fuel to 800 °K (527 °C) and increases the specific impulse by as much as 10%.\n \nMetal powders are added either to solid propellants in the manufacture of rocket engines or to liquid propellants to form a suspension for rocket engines.\nBecause the surface area to volume ratio of such small particles is very high/large, the oxidizing agent surrounds and quickly burns each metal particle, releasing a large amount of energy per unit weight at very high temperatures.\n \nAluminum powder is relatively inexpensive and is used more often than other metals as a component in solid-fuel and liquid-fuel rocket engines to increase propellant momentum and stabilize combustion.\nBeryllium, boron, magnesium, and zirconium powders are much more expensive, dangerous, and difficult to handle, which is why they are rarely used in practice.\n \nThe aluminum powder as the main ingredient is also used in aerosol paints. Spherical aluminum is used as a catalyst, as a component for turbine surfacing materials, as a raw material for additive (3D) manufacturing machines, etc.\n \nExternally, factory-made aluminum powder is a gray or light silver powder. Rocket-grade particles range in size from 3 to 100 microns, although there are cases of using powder with larger particles. The shape of the particle is spherical or spheroidal. Beryllium, magnesium and zirconium powders are also gray or light silver. Boron powder is dark brown, and the color of the suspension depends on the liquid in which the powder is mixed.\n                                                                                                                                                           \nFor example, boron mixed with dicyclopentadiene is a potential fuel for ramjet-type aircraft engines and produces a brownish-chocolate suspension of honey consistency rocket fuel, i.e. like the RP-1 and JP-10, they are similar in appearance.\n \nWhen shipped, aluminum powder is typically packaged in steel drums of 30 gallons (114 L) or less. The weight of one such drum is approximately 180 kg. Other metal powders will be transported with a similar type of container.\n \nAdditional information: The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm3, but the bulk density is somewhat lower and depends on the particle size.\n \nBeryllium and its combustion products are very toxic. Boron is hardly flammable. Zirconium powder is very dangerous to handle as it is self-igniting when exposed to air, so it is shipped in mixture with water[90].\n\n\n[90] https://mtcr.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MTCR-Handbook-2017-INDEXED-FINAL-Digital.pdf\n\n\nAs specified in 1C111.a.1, dual-use products include spherical or spheroidal aluminum powders, other than those specified in the military items control list, with uniform particles less than 200 µm in diameter and containing 97% or more aluminum by weight, provided that at least 10% of the total weight contains particles smaller than 63 µm (250 mesh (Tyler)/230 mesh (ASTM standard E-11)), according to ISO 2591:1988 or national equivalents;\n \nThe Military items List controls spherical aluminum powder (CAS 7429-90-5), with a particle size of 60 µm or less, made from a material containing 99% or more aluminum.\n \nIn both cases, the key characteristics of strategic aluminum powder are uniform particle size (<60/200 μm), the spherical shape of the particle, and high content of aluminum in the alloy (>97/99%), however, these parameters are not important for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices.\n \nInformation about the mentioned parameters is usually indicated in the documentation issued by the manufacturer (material safety data sheet (MSDS), technical passport) and on the manufacturer's website, quality certificate, expert/laboratory/granulometric analysis, often in the customs declaration, invoice, packaging, etc.\n \nFor example, in the safety data sheets for aluminum powder produced by the “American ELEMENTS” company, we can find all the parameters necessary for product identification, in particular: aluminum content 99.99%, particle shape spherical, and average particle size 18 nm.\n \nAccording to this characteristic, this aluminum powder is classified as a military item and requires a permit for transit, import and export[91].\n [91] https://www.americanelements.com/aluminum-nanoparticles-7429-90-5\n \nAluminum powders: ПА-1, ПА-2, ПА-3, ПА-4 are produced in CIS countries. IAccording to the manufacturers documentation, the powders comply with the ГОСТ 6058-73- standard, according to which the powders of this brand are intended for use in pyrotechnics, ferrous metallurgy, chemical industry, welding of metals, etc., the particles are not spherical in shape; particle sizes are heterogeneous and vary in the range of 0.02-2000 microns, and the average size is 66-100 microns; Aluminum content is not less than 98-99%.  \n\n\n\n\nMaterials used in the manufacture of equipment and installations resistant to corrosive chemicals\nThe equipment defined by the ECCN 2B350 of the control list is an essential attribute for the chemical, oil refining, pharmaceutical, food and other industries, in agriculture and domestic consumption, and, therefore, the share of this and similar equipment in the total cargo turnover is quite large.\n \nHowever, this does not mean that all reactors, tanks, pumps, fittings, etc. correspond to the parameters set by the control list and are subject to permit control.\n \nIn order to clearly understand what types of equipment are assigned a strategic purpose, let's first consider the materials specified in the characteristics of equipment classified in 2B350\n \nSince most of the toxic chemicals and their precursors are highly corrosive, equipment, machinery and their components used in the chemical weapons development cycle must be made of corrosion-resistant materials.\n \nAccordingly, corrosion resistance is one of the main characteristic parameters for chemical production equipment subject to export controls.\n \nFor example, equipment and components for the chemical industry classified under ECCN 2B350 of the control list require all surfaces that come into direct contact with processed or stored chemicals to be made or coated with: high nickel and chromium alloys, fluoropolymers with high fluorine composition, glass, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, niobium (columbium) or \"alloys\" of these metals.\n \nAs a rule, there are several international identifiers for alloys (Unified Numbering System for commercial materials (UNS), International Standardization System (ISO), ASTM, DIN, ГОСТ, etc.), among which there is some correspondence.\n \nNumbers that comply with UNS, ISO, ASTM, DIN, GOST and other standards are used to describe goods in technical passports, customs declarations, invoices, expert opinions, certificates and other documents, which is important and necessary information for documentary identification of goods.\n \nOften, an identification number defined by one of the above standards is applied to a product or device, and from such lebelling it is possible to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of the material from which the item is made.\n \ne.g. The UNS number consists of one letter and five numeric characters, where the Latin letter denotes the type of alloy/metal and the range of numbers is associated with the base metal of the alloy.\n \ne.g. The UNS number N10276, (referring to a metal containing 51% nickel, 14.5-16.5% chromium, and 16% molybdenum), indicates that it is a nickel alloy and contains more nickel than any other metal. Trade names of such metal are Hastelloy C-276, Inconel alloy C-276, Nickelvac 276, AL 276.\n \nFor the equipment and accessories for the chemical industry of strategic purpose (chemical reactors, mixers, storage tanks, valves, pumps, etc.), the list specifies two types of high-nickel alloys:\n \nAlloys containing more than 25% nickel and more than 20% chromium by weight; and nickel or alloys containing more than 40% nickel by weight.\n \nMany different alloys meet these criteria, including alloys under the following trade names: Hastelloy®, Inconel®, Incoloy®, Monel® and Nickelvac®. But, it should be noted that not all alloys of this designation always correspond to the parameters given in the control list, and in order to determine the exact composition of the metal, it is necessary to find the manufacturer's information.\n \nThe table gives examples of alloys with a high mass percentage of nickel and nickel-chromium, according to the International Unified Numbering System (UNS) for alloys:\n\n\n\n\nTantalum, titanium, zirconium and niobium are known as \"reactive metals\" - metals that react with oxygen. As a result, a protective, corrosion-resistant oxide layer is formed on their surface.\nThese materials are often referred to as \"exotic metals\".\n \nAlloys of these metals are controlled by the latest technical note to 2B350:\n \nFor the materials listed in the above paragraphs, the term \"alloys\", when no specific concentration of elements is indicated, means alloys of that metal which is present in the alloy in a higher percentage by weight than any other element.\n \nThat is, since for alloys of tantalum, titanium, zirconium and niobium the concentration limit of elements has not been established, any alloy in which the proportion of these metals is greater than the proportion of all other metals is subject to control.\n \nTitanium alloys are often denoted by the chemical symbol Ti in the name of the alloy. There are several grades of \"commercially pure\" titanium, often designated by a grade number (for example, Ti Grade # or simply Grade #) and titanium alloys. The most common form of titanium is Grade2).\n \nDue to its resistance to aggressive chemicals, titanium devices are widely used in power plants, chemical plants, oil refineries, filtration plants, liquefied gas plants, offshore platforms, etc.\n \nTitanium alloys are resistant to substances such as salt, phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfuric and organic acids, bleaches, chlorine, alkali solutions, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, inorganic salts, fresh and sea water.\n \nIn the Unified Numbering System (USN), titanium alloys are designated in the range R50001–R59999.\n \nTantalum -the corrosion resistance of is often compared to glass. Like other reactive metals, tantalum exhibits high corrosion resistance to acids.Tantalum is used in devices that come into contact with salt, phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfur and other strong organic acids, as well as bromine and pharmaceuticals.\n \nHeat exchangers, condensers, chemical tanks, columns, valve covers and other equipment are made from tantalum.\n \nIn the Unified Numbering System (UNS), the range R05001–R05999 is allocated to the designation numbers for tantalum alloys.\n \nThe chemical symbol for tantalum is Ta, which may appear in the names of tantalum alloys. e.g. Tantalum 2.5% Tungsten (97.5Ta-2.5W; Ta2.5W; Tantalum-Tungsten 2.5%; KBI-6®); Tantalum 10% Tungsten (90Ta-10W; Ta10W; KBI-10®); and Tantalum 40% Niobium (60Ta-40Nb; Ta40Nb; KBI-40®). All three types of alloys are used as structural materials for manufacturing various types of chemical technological equipment.\n \nZirconium -is one of the most corrosion-resistant metals against organic and inorganic acids, alkaline substances, hydrogen peroxide and many other substances. It is widely used both in the chemical industry and in nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel production processes.\n \nIn the Unified Numbering System (UNS), zirconium alloys are assigned designations in the range R60001–R69999. The chemical symbol for zirconium, Zr, often appears in alloy names and is an indicator of the presence of zirconium as the base metal in the alloy. \nFor example, zirconium alloys most commonly used in the chemical industry are ASTM Zr702, Zr704, Zr705, and Zr706. Zircadyne® is the trade name for certain zirconium alloys (eg Zircadyne®702, Zircadyne®705) used in chemical plants.\n \nNiobium (Columbium) is mainly used in the aerospace, nuclear and superconducting industries, but it can be used to make chemical industry capacitors, heat exchangers, valve covers, etc.\n \nIn the Unified Numbering System (UNS), niobium alloys correspond to designations in the range R04001–R04999. The chemical symbol of niobium Nb and/or the archaic name columbium (Cb) can be found in the names of alloys, e.g. niobium alloy with 1% zirconium content, denoted by symbols: Nb-1Zr, Nb-Zirc, Niobium-Zirc, Niobium Zirconium, Niobium-1 Zirconium , NB-1%Zr, Niobium 1% Zirc, or Nb1Zr), C-103, C-129Y, Cb-752, C-3009; Niobium alloy with 7.5% tantalum - Nb7.5 Ta®, and niobium alloy with 47% titanium - Nb47Ti®.\n \nFerrosilicon-is a type of iron alloy, in which the silicon content is much higher (15–90%) than in cast iron. Ferrosilicon is available under the following trade names: Duriron™, Durichlor™, Superchlor™ and Siguss®. Ferrosilicon is highly resistant to sulfuric acid, which leads to its use in devices related to the production of sulfuric acid.\nFerrosilicon also exhibits resistance to the corrosive properties of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and other aggressive substances.\n \nAlloys with a high content of ferrosilicon are widely used in the oil refining industry, in the production of sulfuric and nitric acids, in the processing of metals, in the production of explosives, paints, fertilizers, etc.\n \nIn the control list, ferrosilicon as a material of construction from chemical industry equipment is provided only for pumps specified in the ECCN 2B350.i.3.\n \nFluoropolymers- are fluorine-containing polymeric or elastomeric materials with high corrosion resistance.\n \nFluoroplasts- are relatively high molecular mass forming polymers in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms. Fluoroplasts look very similar to other plastics and can be found in different colors.\n \nFluoroelastomers -are fluorinated synthetic rubbers that are often used to make gaskets.\n \nFluoropolymers are used in the food industry, pharmaceutical production, metallurgy, etc.\nMore commonly, fluoropolymers are referred to by their trade names or abbreviations, rather than their long scientific names.\n \nIn the control list, fluoropolymers are specified as a material of construction for all chemical equipment specified in 2B350.\n \nFor use in these equipment, fluoropolymers (polymeric or elastomeric materials) with more than 35% fluorine by weight are preferred.\n\n\nThe table lists some relatively common fluoropolymers with their abbreviation, technical name, trade name, and percentage of fluorine.\n \nGlass (Vitreous enamel or enamel) is used in chemical reactors, storage tanks, distillation columns, heat exchangers, pumps, etc. for surface finishing.\n \nVitreous enamel can be applied to many types of metals (eg stainless steel, aluminium, copper, cast iron, etc.) and is usually blue in color.\n \nVitreous enamel has many properties, incl. It is smooth, inert, corrosion resistant, easy to clean, non-flammable, etc., so it is widely used in the chemical industry.\n\n\nCeramics as a structural material is listed in the specifications of heat exchangers and condensers, valves, pumps, waste recycling furnaces.\n \nSuch ceramic material can be silicon carbide (chemical designation - SiC; one of the trade names - Hexoloy®), titanium carbide (TiC), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and others.\n \nValves\n \nHS Heading 8481\nValves with ‘nominal sizes’ greater than 10 mm and casings (valve bodies) or preformed casing liners designed for such valves, in which all surfaces that come in direct contact with the chemical(s) being processed or contained are made from any of the following materials:\n1. ‘Alloys’ with more than 25 % nickel and 20 % chromium by weight;\n2. Fluoropolymers (polymeric or elastomeric materials with more than 35 % fluorine by weight);\n3. Glass (including vitrified or enameled coatings or glass lining);\n4. Nickel or ‘alloys’ with more than 40 % nickel by weight;\n5. Tantalum or tantalum ‘alloys’;\n6. Titanium or titanium ‘alloys’;\n7. Zirconium or zirconium ‘alloys’;\n8. Niobium (columbium) or niobium ‘alloys’; or\n9. Ceramic materials as follows:\na. Silicon carbide with a purity of 80 % or more by weight;\nb. Aluminium oxide (alumina) with a purity of 99,9 % or more by weight;\nc. Zirconium oxide (zirconia);\n \n2B350.g –Valves\nValves are used to control fluid flow. In practice, there are many valve configurations that differ from each other in the materials and type of construction, the number of ports, the type of connecting ends, the shape of the body, and the type of closing/opening mechanism.\nAccordingly, the name of the valves corresponds to their design features and functions, such as check valves, ball valves, regulating valves, disc valves, butterfly valves, plug valves, bellows valves, diaphragm/diaphragm valves, etc.\nFor the purposes of 2B350.g, the strategic purpose of a valve does not depend on its design and is determined by the size of the valve, the materials from which the contact surface with the gas or liquid is made, and the possibility of interchangeability of the locking elements of the construction.\n \nIn view of the above, the 2B350.g includes a diverse set of valves.\n \nValves are characterized by two or more connections (ports) and opening and closing mechanisms.\nCouplings may have flanges, screws, or a combination of them to seal pipes.\nValves can be controlled (open/closed) mechanically, by an operator, or automatically;\nThe valve may be actuated by an electric, pneumatic, hydraulic or manual actuator.\n \nThe photos show valves of various constructions, functions, automatic and manual controls, coated with various corrosion-resistant alloys and fluoropolymers, used in the chemical industry.\n \nThe valve body is often engraved or labelled containing the manufacturer's name, model number of the valve or part, material grade, etc. This information is very useful for finding and/or identifying additional information about the valve.\n \nIt is considered strategic if:\nValves with a 'nominal size' greater than 10 mm (DN 10 or NPS 3/8) if the wettable surface of its body is lined or made with materials specified in 2B350.g; and\n \nValves, 25 mm to 100 mm 'nominal size' (DN25/ NPS1 to DN 100/NPS4) having interchangeable shut-off elements (eg balls, plugs, diaphragms/diaphragms, discs, etc.) provided, that the wettable surface of their hulls is made of the materials specified in 2B350.g.\n \nThus, a ball valve, NPS 5 (≈DN125), whose inside diameter body is lined with a fluoropolymer and the ball is made of carbon steel and is replaceable, is subject to control.\n \nWhen shipped, small valves are usually boxed (one valve per box) and often wrapped in plastic. Cushioning can be provided in the box. Oversized valves can be packaged in a box or mounted on a stand/pad. In this case, the ports should probably be sealed to prevent clogging of the valve.\n \nStrategic purpose valves are mainly used in the chemical industry, e.g. in the Chloralkali process, in the petrochemical industry, in the production of agrochemicals, cellulose-paper and pharmaceutical products, in energy sector, etc.\nIn addition to the above:\nECCN 0B001 of the control list regulates bellow-sealed valves for nuclear enrichment processes which should be made of materials resistant to uranium fluoride corrosion (copper, stainless steel, aluminium, alumina, aluminum alloys, nickel, or alloys containing 60% or more nickel and UF6 , resistant to fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers) and should have a diameter of 10-160 mm or 40-1500 mm; but\nECCN 2A226 controls valves with a nominal size (smallest diameter for valves with different inlet or outlet sizes) of 5 mm and larger and made of aluminum, aluminum alloys, nickel, or alloys containing 60% or more nickel.\nECCN 7A116 controls servo valves for space launch vehicles, space probes, or rockets. The use of such valves is of paramount importance for the control of such powerful systems as advanced liquid-propellant rocket engines. Servo valves are complex electromechanical devices that control the fuel supply in rocket engines.\nStorage Tanks, Containers or Receivers for Chemical Substances\nStorage tanks, containers or receivers with a total internal (geometric) volume greater than 0,1 m3 (100 litres) where all surfaces that come in direct contact with the chemical(s) being processed or contained are made from any of the following materials:\n1. ‘Alloys’ with more than 25 % nickel and 20 % chromium by weight;\n2.

Typically, one of the rings remains stationary while the other ring rotates through the balls;\nDuring operation, radial ball bearings are subjected to radial, axial, momentary, reverse-axial, or combined loads.\n \nDue to the wide range of applications, there are frequent cases of radial ball bearings of various types moving at the border, but bearings are considered strategic if they comply with the tolerance classes and dimensions established by the specified standards.\nISO 492 tolerance class 2 and ANSI/ABMA STD 20 tolerance class ABEC-9 mean the highest manufacturing quality of precision bearings.\n \nCorrespondence of tolerance classes according to different standards is given in the table[92]:\n\n\n[92] https://www.astbearings.com/bearing-tolerances-precision-levels.html\n\nABEC\n\n\t\n\nISO 492\n\n\t\n\nDIN 620\n\n\t\n\nJIS B1514\n\n\n\n\nABEC 1\n\n\t\n\nnormal\nclass 6X\n\n\t\n\nP0\n\n\t\n\nClass 0\n\n\n\n\nABEC 3\n\n\t\n\nclass 6\n\n\t\n\nP6\n\n\t\n\nClass 6\n\n\n\n\nABEC 5\n\n\t\n\nclass 5\n\n\t\n\nP5\n\n\t\n\nClass 5\n\n\n\n\nABEC 7\n\n\t\n\nclass 4\n\n\t\n\nP4\n\n\t\n\nClass 4\n\n\n\n\nABEC 9\n\n\t\n\nclass 2\n\n\t\n\nP2\n\n\t\n\nClass 2\n\nAn inscription indicating the tolerance class is located on the bearing, transport/customs documents, packaging, etc., which makes it easier for us to identify this type of goods. for example\n \nStrategic-purpose radial ball bearings are generally shipped in medium-sized cartons and do not require any type of special packaging for shipping.\n \nBall bearings are also controlled by the five-digit alphanumeric code 2A001 of the dual-use items control list, according to which strategic ball bearings are considered ISO 492 standard 4 or higher class, provided that the rings and balls are made of Monel (Monel- nickel alloy, 52-67% nickel and copper alloy) or beryllium.\n \nToxic gas monitoring systems and related detectors\nECCN 2B351\nHS Codes: 853180, 853190, 902710; 902720, 902730, 902790\n \n2B351 Toxic gas monitors and monitoring systems and their dedicated detecting components, other than those specified in 1A004, as follows; and detectors; sensor devices; and replaceable sensor cartridges therefor:\n \na. Designed for continuous operation and usable for the detection of chemical warfare agents or chemicals specified in 1C350, at concentrations of less than 0.3 mg/m3; or\nb. Designed for the detection of cholinesterase-inhibiting activity.\n \nBasic Description:\nToxic gas monitoring systems are an integral part of hazardous facilities for the production, processing, and disposal of chemicals. Of course, such systems are also used at facilities working with chemical warfare agents.\n \nMonitors are subsystems of detection systems that can operate continuously and sample the environment (i.e., without constant human intervention) to immediately inform personnel of the presence of a particular agent or precursor.\n \n \nContinuous air monitoring systems that operate in near real-time mode can very quickly notify personnel of a leak/splash within minutes, while other systems may be used in a laboratory setting for longer sampling periods and to verify readings/data from continuous air monitors.\nToxic gas monitoring systems and specialized detection components are considered strategic if they have one of the following characteristics:\na. Continuous operation and the ability to detect specified concentration levels of certain chemicals associated with chemical weapons, or\nb. Discovery of the activity of cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g nerve-paralytic agents sarin, soman, etc.).\n \nVisual and/or audible alarms should be activated on detectors or main control units to warn personnel of the presence of a dangerous concentration of toxic gases in the working environment;;\n \nThe device may have a numeric display panel for displaying detected gas data and markings along the panel indicating the concentration unit (e.g, parts per million or ppm).\n \nToxic gas monitoring systems mainly use two popular detection methods: ion motion (or mobility or displacement) spectroscopy (IMS) and gas chromatography (GC) in combination with (or combining or using) different types of detectors.\nOther detection methods include surface acoustic wave (SAW) spectroscopy, infrared (eg OP-FTIR), electrochemical detection, or photoionization detection (PID). However, regardless of the detection method, documentary identification must consider what types of chemicals and concentrations the detection system can detect and whether it can operate continuously.\n \nToxic gas monitoring systems and related detectors are transported in the same way as other sensitive electronic devices. Each device must be packed in a carton and protected with STYROFOAM™ sheet or equivalent. Individual components must be sealed in plastic bags or in cardboard inner containers.\n \nToday, gas analysis systems are used in almost all types of industry, in populated areas and cities, and in general, to determine the cleanliness and quality of air in the environment, for scientific research, etc. Therefore, the detection of chemical agents is not always the purpose of gas monitoring systems.\n \nWhen identifying such items, the main determining factor is the list of gases indicated in the technical data sheet of the device.\n \nFor example, OIZOM's Polludrone- real-time air monitoring system, which simultaneously combines the ability to monitor various air quality parameters (such as harmful gases, dust concentrations, radiation, etc.), continuously collects, collects and transmits data.\n\n\nCrucibles\n \nHS Codes: 6903 10; 6903 20; 6903 90; 8103 91; 8112 39; 8112 31; 8112 99\nThe above information was derived from \"A Handbook for the Nuclear Suppliers Group Dual-Use Annex,\" published by the U.S. Department of Energy in April 1996[93].\n\n\n[93] https://database.riskreport.org\n2A225 Crucibles made of materials resistant to liquid actinide metals, as follows:\na.

Made of or lined with tantalum, having a purity of 98 % or greater by weight; and\n3. Coated with tantalum carbide, nitride, boride, or any combination thereof.\n \nVarious goods classified under the above HS codes (for example, refractory ceramic products (for example, retorts, crucibles, muffles, plugs, chokes, stands, jars, pipes, tubes, casings, rods, shafts and plugs etc.), when moving across the border, always the question arises whether this goods are dual-use items classified under the ECCN 2A225.\nA crucible is a ceramic or metal vessel in which metals or other substances can be melted or processed at very high temperatures. They are made from materials whose melting point is significantly higher than that of the metal or substance being processed, which is resistant to corrosion and inert to aggressive chemicals.\nActinoids or actinides belong to a family of 15 radioactive chemical elements, which includes uranium, plutonium and thorium. It is these elements that are used as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors and weapons of mass destruction. To be used for these purposes, these substances are heated/baked in crucibles and shaped into certain sizes. Therefore, crucibles must be made of materials that can withstand high temperatures (for example, the melting point of uranium dioxide 2875 ° C) and the chemical attack of these substances.\nThe Niobium-Titanium-Tungsten alloy is the color of 316 stainless steel when initially formed, but turns golden as a result of nitriding. An alloy is relevant if it contains about 50% Nb, 30% Ti and 20% W. For example, the Nb-30Ti-20W composition alloy is \"TRIBOCOR 532N\" (Fansteel), which is forged by the usual traditional method.\n \nThe metal can be easily worked and it is possible to obtain details of various complex shapes from it by cold or mechanical working and welding. Surface nitriding at temperatures > 1800°C achieves high surface hardness of the alloy. The metal is corrosively resistant to aggressive environments, including hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric and sulfuric acids, as well as chloride solutions, and is inert in contact with uranium and uranium alloys.\nCrucibles made from other materials specified in 2A225.a. are primarily used for melting and casting metallic ductile materials. Due to nuclear criticality, crucibles with a capacity of more than 6.5 liters are not used.\nCrucibles specified in 2A225.b and 2A225.c are used for melting and casting plutonium to produce components for nuclear explosive devices. In this case, 0.05 L (50 cm3)-2 L (2000 cm3) capacity crucibles made of tantalum or coated with tantalum compounds are considered strategic.\n \nSince high purity of the product is necessary for this process, the best option is to use tantalum, which minimizes the reaction of plutonium with the crucible and provides the possibility of using the electron-beam melting procedure.\nCompressors\n \nECCN: 0B004. b.2\nHS subheading: 8414 80\n \n* Plant for the production or concentration of heavy water, deuterium and deuterium compounds and specially designed or prepared equipment and components therefor, as follows:\n- Single stage, low head (i.e. 0,2 MPa) centrifugal blowers or compressors for hydrogen sulphide gas circulation (i.e. gas containing more than 70 % H2S) with a throughput capacity greater than or equal to 56 m3/second when operating at pressures greater than or equal to 1,8 MPa suction and having seals designed for wet H2S service.\n \nA compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of gas by reducing (compressing/pumping) its volume. Depending on the construction and functional purpose, there are many types of compressors (piston, centrifugal, screw, membrane, etc.), which are actively used in all areas of industry, where it is necessary to create high gas pressure or its lower volume.\nAir blowers and compressors used to circulate hydrogen sulfide gas in water-hydrogen exchange columns are difficult to distinguish from compressors for the petrochemical industry, as can be seen in the first, second and fourth photos. However, useful information about such devices can be gleaned from information plates, which are likely to be affixed to the compressor/air damper, its motor or gear housing. For example, if a compressor has a nameplate, it will indicate the manufacturer and some design parameters such as case size, rotational speed, and the maximum amount of pressure the case can withstand.\n \nThese compressors ensure the circulation of wet (moist) hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the upper low-temperature exchange column (cold column) to the lower part of the high-temperature exchange column (hot column) in the two-temperature water-hydrogen sulfide exchange process, which is a heavy water production process (so-called Girdler -Sulfide or GS process).\n \nHydrogen sulfide gas saturated with water vapor in the cooling column enters the circulator, where typical conditions for the cooling column are created: the pressure is about 2 MPa, and the temperature is 35°С. The required circulator pressure rise is about 0.2 MPa, which is equivalent to a very low power jet (≈7500 J/kg), which can easily be obtained with a single-stage centrifugal compressor or air damper.          \n \nA machine producing such a weak jet is more commonly called an air blower. The first photo shows a single-stage compressor/air blower with its transmission consisting of an electric motor, a reducer, and a coupling.\n \nCompressors for the Girdler-Sulfide process are driven directly by the motor (ie no gearbox is required). The second photo shows a weak-jet single-stage centrifugal compressor designed for the low pressures typical of the Girdler-Sulfide process for heavy water production.\nGS air blowers and their drive systems are designed with wet hydrogen sulfide properties in mind. e.g.     \n \nA long connector may be used between the motor and the air damper to minimize the possibility of hydrogen sulfide electric current explosion.\nCompressor materials should be selected taking into account the corrosive properties of hydrogen sulfide.\n \nA key feature of centrifugal compressors and air blowers and a detail differentiating them from conventional air compressors is the vane disk (compressor vane; compressor working eye), a complex rotating component that transfers energy to the process gas.\n \nAs the vane disc is subjected to high loads and may break due to sulphide corrosion, it should be made of aluminum. The vane discs of the compressor are shown in photo 3.\n \nCompressor housings can be made of carbon steel, as well as AISI 316 austenitic stainless steel.\n \nCarbon or stellite (a stellite-alloy mainly containing cobalt, chromium and tungsten) gaskets are used in compressors to minimize the risk of hydrogen sulfide gas leakage into the environment.\n \nAs mentioned above, compressors are mechanical devices used to increase pressure in various compressible liquids or gases, most commonly air pressure. Compressors are needed in all industries to supply air to workshops or equipment, pneumatic tools, paint sprayers and abrasive-jet machines, air cooling systems, dryers, gas pipelines, etc.\n \nTherefore, it is very common to import, export and transit compressors, and each time it is necessary to determine whether this particular equipment is of strategic purpose.\n \nAs specified in 0B004.b.2, the compressor shall be of the single-stage centrifugal type. Therefore, the screw, diesel, piston and other standard compressors shown in the photo, which are most often found, regardless of their cost, dimensions and other parameters, do not represent the scope of interest of the checklist:\nCentrifugal compressors are used primarily in large-volume equipment, such as commercial refrigeration units, large processing plants, and pipelines, and can supply up to 200,000 cubic feet per hour (340,000 m3/hr) of air.\nThe manufacturer does not indicate that the compressor is prepared to work with hydrogen sulfide.\n \nIf we compare the characteristics of this compressor with the parameters specified in 0B004.b.2, we will see that the construction characteristics of the compressor DAC550 do not meet the requirements of 0B004.b.2, in particular, the compressor DAC550 is not single-stage and is not prepared to work with hydrogen sulfide, And its maximum capacity (=35160 m3/h) is much less than 56 m3/s (=201600 m3/h).Therefore, we can assume that the DAC550 compressor is not a strategic product.\n \nLightweight turbojet and turbofan engines[94]\n\n\n[94]https://mtcr.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MTCR-Handbook-2017-INDEXED-FINAL-Digital.pdf\n HS headings: 8411, 8807,\nTurbojet and turbofan engines, other than those specified in 9A001, as follows;\na. Engines having both of the following characteristics:\n1. Maximum thrust value greater than 400 N (achieved uninstalled) excluding civil certified engines with a maximum thrust value greater than 8 890 N (achieved uninstalled), and\n2. Specific fuel consumption of 0,15 kg/N/hr or less (at maximum continuous power at sea level static and standard conditions);\nb. Engines designed or modified for use in “missiles” or unmanned aerial vehicles specified in 9A012\n \nTurbojet Engine-is an aircraft jet engine commonly used in airplanes. It consists of a gas turbine and a jet nozzle. The gas turbine has an air intake with an intake manifold, a compressor and a combustion chamber, as well as a turbine driven by a compressor.\n \nA turbofan or fan jet engine is also a type of aerojet engine that is widely used in aircraft propulsion systems. These types of engines have a single-stage, large-diameter fan that delivers a large volume of air through the engine at any airspeed, including low takeoff and landing speeds.\n \nEngines of the mentioned category can move unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles over long distances. These engines are very similar in construction to civil aircraft engines, but with smaller dimensions and power.\n \n \nThe photo shows a small Williams F107 (WR19) turbofan engine manufactured by Williams International (weight 30 kg, main rotor diameter: 0.3 m, special fuel consumption: 69.6 kg/kN/h (0.0696 kg/N/h); maximum thrust force for various modifications 1.9-6.22 kN), which was created for cruise missiles.\n \nThe main sub-components of gas turbine engines are fan (in case of turbofan engine), compressor, combustion chamber and turbine.\nThe compressor, which consists of one or more stages of stationary and rotating blades of aerodynamic cross-section, suffocates the air, compresses it and sends it to the combustion chamber.\n \nThe combustion chamber is a heat-resistant (high-temperature resistant) tube in which air is mixed with fuel vapors (evaporating, evaporating fuel) and ignited. Burning continues even after ignition.\n \nIgnition is initiated by spark plugs. Combustion products, i.e., exhaust gases, enter the turbine, which consists of one or more stages of mutually fixed and rotating aerodynamic blades. The turbine takes as much energy from the gas stream as is necessary to drive the compressor. The remaining energy provides traction.\n \nNext, the gas flow will pass through a compression channel or nozzle to maximize the thrust created by the engine. A turbofan engine has a large diameter multi-bladed fan stage ahead of the compressor.\nTurbofan engines typically have higher thrust and lower fuel consumption than turbojet engines.\n \nTurbojet engines are used in shipbuilding, energy and some types of land transport. Marine gas turbine engines are used by naval and civil ships.\n \nAppearance: A typical small gas turbine engine has the shape of a cylinder less than one meter long and 0.5 meters in diameter. Many accessories such as alternator, hydraulic pump, fuel pump, metering valve and related wiring are visible on the engine.\n \nSmall economical engines weigh 30-130 kg. Larger sized motors have 1m. diameter and 3 m. length.\nEngine parts are made of various materials, both metallic (aluminum, steel, titanium and special alloys) and non-metallic (Teflon, nylon, carbon and rubber - used for sealing and insulation) substances.\nPhoto 2. Small turbofan engines for cruise missiles (left and bottom right) and unmanned aerial vehicles (top right).\n \nEngines are usually prepared for transportation in several stages: protective plates are placed on the openings at the head and bottom and fixed with adhesive tape.\n \nThe engine is covered with a protective paper and packages with a moisture-absorbing substance are glued on top. The engine is wrapped in corrugated cardboard, placed in a polyethylene bag, then placed in a solid wooden box on foam blocks, the box is filled with foam and sealed.\n \nSince cruise missile engines are often self-starting using pyrotechnic cartridges, shipping containers must be marked to indicate the presence of explosives when packaged properly (see Photo 3.)\nPhoto 3. In the photo on the right is a wooden box for transporting an engine, with a warning label about the presence of explosive cargo; in the center - a small turbofan engine placed in a\nwooden box and polyethylene; On the right is a small turbojet engine prepared for transportation.\n \nAs an example, consider the General Electric CF34-3 turbofan engine of the Bombardier Challenger 605 civil aircraft, with the following parameters:\nAccording to the control list:\n                                                                                                                                                           A turbofan engine is subject to export controls, if:\n \nMaximum thrust value greater than 400 N, and for civil certified engines -8 890 N;\n  Specific fuel consumption of 0,15 kg/N/hr or less;\n\"dry weight\" less than 750 kg;\n \nThe diameter of the rotor of the first stage, in this case the fan, is less than 1 m. If you compare the characteristics, you can see that the CF34-3 engine has significantly better maximum thrust value and less fuel consumption, and the diameter and weight are slightly higher than indicated in the control list.\nDespite the insignificant difference, the CF34-3 was considered a dual-use item and a permit was issued for export.\nIn addition to the engine types described above, the control list includes:\n \nPowerful Aero gas turbine engines (9A001) as well as Ramjet, scramjet or combined cycle engines    (9A011)\nMarine gas turbine engines (9A002), turboprop air engines for unmanned aerial vehicles (9A102), solid fuel (9A107), hybrid (9A109) and impulse (9A111) jet engines, and others.\nMarine gas turbine engines are considered strategic if their ISO standard continuous power rating is equal to or greater than 24245 kW a specific fuel consumption is not more than 0.219 kg/kWh (9A002)-202.7 g/kW-hr\nAccording to the note:\nmarine gas turbine engines’ includes those industrial, or aero-derivative, gas turbine engines adapted for a ship’s electric power generation or propulsion.\n \nAn example of a marine gas turbine engine (9A002) is the General Electric Company's LM6000 gas turbine engine.\n \nThe LM6000 engine is based on the CF6-80C2 aircraft turbofan engine and has been modified for use in shipboard and/or power systems.\nIf we compare the parameters of the LM6000PC engine with the technical parameters defined by the 9A002, we will see that according to its nominal power and fuel consumption, the LM6000PC engine is a strategic item and the dual-use items permit was issued for its export.\n \n \nUnmanned aerial vehicles – UAVs (HS Heading 8802)\nIn recent years, there are sets of frequently asked questions (FAQ) about export/import of unmanned aerial vehicles (so-called drones). The questions are asked on whether they need a permit or not, what type of unmanned aerial vehicles are under control, etc.\n \nUAVs are widely used for strategic, as well as civilian purposes: in military/intelligence operations, for the delivery of missiles, explosive devices and chemical and biological agents, for the supervision and safety of industrial and commercial facilities, in cartography and film industry, tourism and entertainment industry, for agricultural purposes, and in smuggling and other illegal activities. Along with the development of technologies, UAVs have acquired useful as well as harmful functions for a large number of societies. Therefore, the control of the products is extensive control worldwide.\n \nAccording to the definition in the dual-use items control list, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (9) means any aircraft capable of initiating flights and making controlled flight and navigation without any human presence on board.\n \nIn the control list (categories 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9) UAVs have the following meanings:\n-        Complete rocket systems and unmanned aerial vehicle systems, capable of delivering at least 500 kg of payload to a range of at least 300 km (ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, spacecraft and research rockets), complete atmosphere UAVs (including wing missiles, radio operated targets and intelligence drones), capable of delivering at least 500 kg of payload to a range of at least 300 km. These are flying machines flying at high altitudes (up to 20,000 m), can fly for 24-48 hours, while the gross takeoff weight is 2,500-12,500 kg (HALE, MALE);\n-        Complete rocket systems and complete atmosphere UAVs, which are not required to carry 500 kg of payload, but can fly at a distance of 300 km. These are UAVs with a long duration of flight and with the gross takeoff weight from 50 kg up to 1,500 kg (9A112.a);\n-        UAVs having autonomous flight control and navigation capabilities due to direct natural vision of the operator, incorporating an aerosol dispensing systems/mechanisms with a capacity greater than 20 liters or designed or modified to incorporate an aerosol dispensing systems/mechanisms with a capacity greater than 20 liters. Such UAVs can be operated by the navigation system on-board and can be moved from a programmable route or satellite or from the operational area by the operator. Chemical agents are represented in the form of aerosol, powder or liquid substances, e.g. such as pesticides for fogging fields, dry chemicals for the formation of aerosol clouds or for the artificial separation of rainfall from clouds. UAVs equipped with aerosol dispersion devices often have the form of a helicopter and are used for pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture. As a rule, these devices are characterized by lower resistance, limited flight distances and durations, but similar models can also be encountered in controlled aircraft. These kinds of UAVs are classified under ECCN 9A112.b within the control list and are subject to export control.\n-        small-size UAVs, with a maximum endurance higher than or equal to 30 minutes, but lower than 1 hour and designed to take-off and have stable controlled flights in wind gusts equal to or exceeding 46,3 km/h (25 knots); or with a maximum endurance of 1 hour or higher;\nThese UAVs are controlled by the Missile Technologies Control Regime (MTCR), whose purpose was the control of the proliferation of nuclear weapons delivery systems at the time of its formation (1987), in particular, systems capable of delivering at least 500 kg of payload to a range of at least 300 km. Since 1992, MTCR has expanded its control and covered UAVs for all types of mass destruction. These parameters under which such devices were subject to control\n-        were included in the control list (WA-LIST (14) 2, 25-03-2015) in 2015, as it is considered that small-size UAVs can cause strategic threats and can also be used to deliver military cargoes to the place of destination. These kinds of UAVs are classified under ECCN 9A012 within the control list and are subject to export control.\nMachine tools for turning, machine tools for milling, machine tools for grinding, cutting (removing) machines, weaving machines, deep-hole-drilling machines \n \n(ECCNs 1B001, 2B001-2B003, 2B201, 2B204): HS Headings 8446-8460\n \nMachine tools for removing metals, ceramics or composites are used for making machine tools, jewelry, wood and other household and civilian products. In addition, these machine tools make available critical details for the equipment used to manufacture nuclear weapons and uranium enrichment plants (for example, cylinders for centrifuges, nuclear reactor components, bearings, etc.), powder materials and explosive devices for making rocket fuel, metals and composite powder and other materials, which results in their strategic significance. Simply put, machine tools intended for making especially sensitive products and components included in the control list are also subject to control.\n \nThe classification of machine tools according to the dual use items control list is carried out on the basis of their accuracy (positioning accuracy and the size and surface of the axle), the number of axles and numerical control.\n \nFor example, the following machine tools are considered as dual use items and their export is controlled:\nMachine tools for turning and cutting that can be equipped with electronic devices for numerical control, having two or more axes, which can be coordinated simultaneously for contouring control\n, and having unidirectional positioning repeatability equal to or less (better) than 0,9 μm (2B001.a; 2B001.b);\nMachine tools for turning, machine tools for milling, machine tools for grinding, cutting (removing) machines, weaving machines, deep-hole-drilling machines \n \n(ECCNs 1B001, 2B001-2B003, 2B201, 2B204): HS Headings 8446-8460\n \nMachine tools for removing metals, ceramics or composites are used for making machine tools, jewelry, wood and other household and civilian products. In addition, these machine tools make available critical details for the equipment used to manufacture nuclear weapons and uranium enrichment plants (for example, cylinders for centrifuges, nuclear reactor components, bearings, etc.), powder materials and explosive devices for making rocket fuel, metals and composite powder and other materials, which results in their strategic significance. Simply put, machine tools intended for making especially sensitive products and components included in the control list are also subject to control.\n \nThe classification of machine tools according to the dual use items control list is carried out on the basis of their accuracy (positioning accuracy and the size and surface of the axle), the number of axles and numerical control.\n \nFor example, the following machine tools are considered as dual use items and their export is controlled:\nMachine tools for turning and cutting that can be equipped with electronic devices for numerical control, having two or more axes, which can be coordinated simultaneously for contouring control\n, and having unidirectional positioning repeatability equal to or less (better) than 0,9 μm (2B001.a; 2B001.b);\n\n\n-        Machine tools for milling that can be equipped with electronic devices for numerical control, having three or more axes which can be coordinated simultaneously along one or more linear axes for contouring control, and having unidirectional positioning repeatability equal to or lower (better) than 1,1 μm (2B001.c);\nMachine tools for removing metals, ceramics or composites by means of water or other liquid jets, including those employing abrasive additives, electron beam or laser beam, and having at least two rotary axes that can be coordinated simultaneously for contouring control with a positioning accuracy lower (better) than 0,003o etc.\n \nFibrous and filamentary materials\n(ECCNs 1C010, 1C210): HS Headings 5402, 5407, 5503, 6815\n \nAccording to the definition in the dual-use items control list, fibrous or filamentary materials include continuous monofilaments, continuous yarns and roving, tapes, fabrics, random mats and braids, chopped fibers, staple fibers and coherent fiber blankets and whiskers of any length, either monocrystalline or polycrystalline,.\n \nThe dual-use items control list includes organic (aromatic polyamides), inorganic (e.g. glass, quartz, boron, basalt and so forth), ceramic (e.g. aluminum oxide) and carbonated fibers and filaments that are used for modern composite structures (for filling) in order to improve their physical and mechanical properties.\n \n-        One of the examples of synthetic organic fibers is the aramid fiber that has found considerable use in military and aerospace industry. The world's most famous aramid fibers are manufactured as Kevlar® (so-called Para-Arid) and Nomex® (the so-called Meta-Arid) trade marks (manufactured by Du Pont). Aramid tissue is no less strong than steel, and it is about five times lighter. Aramid fibers can withstand high-speed shells and have vibration breakdown properties, so they are used for ballistic protection of military aircraft, also for manufacturing protective reinforced motors, thermal impact protective clothing and armored helmets.\n \nThe classification of organic fibrous or filamentary materials on the basis of the dual use items control list is carried out if they have the following technical properties (1C010.a):\n1. \"Specific modulus\" exceeding 12.7 × 106 m; and\n2. \"Specific tensile strength\" exceeding 23.5 × 104 m[95].\n\n\n[95] According to the definition in the dual-use items control list, \"Specific modulus\" is Young's modulus in Pascal, equivalent to N/m2 divided by specific weight in N/m3, measured at a temperature of (296 ± 2) K ((23 ± 2°C) and a relative humidity of (50 ± 5)%, and \"Specific tensile strength\" is ultimate tensile strength in Pascal, equivalent to N/m2 divided by specific weight in N/m3, measured at a temperature of (296 ± 2) K ((23 ± 2)°C) and a relative humidity of (50 ± 5)%.\n\n\n-        Carbon fibers, known as graphite fibers, are very thin (5-15 microns) in the form of threads composed of microscopic crystals combined with carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are characterized by high tensile strength and low weight. They are resistant to chemical substances and high temperatures and low heat expansion. Because of these qualities, carbon fiber products have been widely used in space industry, wind energy, housing, construction, automotive industry, sports (golf clubs and tennis rockets, skis, bikes), culture (musical instruments - guitar, piano) and entertainment (toys like remote control machines). Some carbon fibers (e.g. HexTow® (Hexcel), SIGAFIL® (SGL Group), TORAYCA® (Toray), PANEX® and PRYON® (Zoltek), also Pyrofil® (Mitsubishi/Grafil)) are used for making strategic products such as nuclear reactor components, uranium enrichment centrifuge rotors, missile batteries, etc. There is information about the existence and use of so-called graphite bombs. This is a bomb containing carbon fibers, which explodes sending carbon fibers the electrical lines and electric power stations, causing short circuits and paralyzing the power system.\nThe classification of organic fibrous or filamentary materials on the basis of the dual use items control list is carried out if they have the following technical properties (1C010.b):\n1. \"Specific modulus\" exceeding 14.65 × 106 m; and\n2. \"Specific tensile strength\" exceeding 23.5 × 104 m..\nCentrifuges\n \n(ECCNs 0B001; 2B122; 2B219; 2B352.c): HS Headings 8401, 8413, 8421\n \nCentrifuge is a device that uses centripetal force to separate the distinctive density of gas, liquid or granular materials. Centrifuges are used in civil areas such as oil and gas extraction, medicine, laboratory surveys, testing, separation of ores and minerals, agriculture and so forth. The control list includes several types of centrifuges with different technical parameters that are used for uranium enrichment, separation of agents of chemical and biological weapons and testing of missile components.\n \nGas centrifuge is a device that makes it possible to separate gases with various molecular masses. Gas centrifugal technology is one of the most economical and effective methods of isotope separation and is widely used to enrich uranium with U-235 isotope.\n \nThere is so-called cylindrical shape rotary rotor placed in vacuum casing, which is supplied with uranium in the gaseous condition - Uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Under the influence of centripetal force generated by the rapid rotation of the rotor, which exceeds several hundred thousand times the gravity of the Earth, the gas begins to be divided into heavier (U-238) and light (U-235) fractions. In the lower axial tube placed in the rotor, the depleted U-238 molecules begin to gather, which are heavier, and the light U-235 will then fall into the centrifuges via upper axial tube until U-235 with the required concentration is received.\n \nThe speed of centrifuge rotation reaches 1,500-2,000 per second, which is 10 times higher than the rotation speed of the engine turbine (for comparison, the washing machine cylinder completes 1,000 rotations per minute). Centrifuge runs continuously for a period of three decades, and performs 2 trillion cycles during work cycles. At the same time, it works with very aggressive and corrosive substance - uranium hexafluoride.\n \n \nThe rotor rotates around the needle that relies on the corundum, and the upper part hangs in the air through the electromagnetic field, which is created by a magnetic suspension bearing (0B001.b.7). It is easy to guess that such a device and all its components should be made of tough special materials resistant to corrosion and mechanical impact.\n \n \nRotors can be manufactured by high-strength maraging steel, titanium, aluminum and aluminum alloys, carbon fibrous and filamentary materials, or nickel alloy containing more than 60% of nickel by weight. Manufactures in the form of tubes or cylindrical solid forms made from such materials are also included in the control list and therefore, they are subject to export control (1C202, 1C210, 1C216).\n \n-        Gas Centrifuge and all its components, as well as all technologies and software related to their design and use are subject to import, export and transit control (2B201, 2B204, 0D001, OE001).\n-        Centrifuges in which the container rotates at a very high speed to create centripetal force in order to enable this force to affect the container's inner part and impart acceleration above 100 g (gravity) are subject to export control, as they can be used to test missile details and to determine statistical characteristics of accelerometer.\nCentrifugal separators, capable of continuous separation with the flow rate exceeding 100 liters per hour, made of components of polished stainless steel or titanium with one or more\n-        sealing joints within the steam containment area capable of in-situ steam sterilization in a closed state are subject to export control, because through the separators it is possible to restore biological agents or toxins with such parameters;\n \nTritium\n \n(ECCN 1C235): HS Heading 2844 40\n \nTritium, or super heavy hydrogen, is a hydrogen radioactive isotope with symbol T or 3H. The value of its half-life is 4,500 ± 8 days (12.32 ± 0.02 years). It releases 18.6 keV of energy in the process of decay, while the share of Beta particles is 5.7 keV and they can penetrate only about 6.0 mm of air, being incapable of passing through the dead outermost layer of human skin. Due to their low energy, electrons emitted from the tritium are easily contained by clothing and surgical rubber gloves, but there is a radioactive threat while breathing, oral reception and absorption from the skin.\n \nTritium is widely used for civil purposes as a source of luminescence. Low-energy beta particles affect phosphorous materials and lead to their lighting. Due to these features, tritium is used in such devices as wrist clocks, targets, direction indicators, bellows, and so forth. Tritium is used in analytical chemistry and nuclear batteries to generate electricity. In addition, tritium, together with deuterium, is used to generate the neutron impulse to initiate the reaction of the nuclear reactor and in the hydrogen bombs – as thermonuclear fuel. Tritium is an important fuel for nuclear synthesis in some types of reactors.\n \nBecause of the importance of tritium in nuclear technologies, the control list includes tritium, tritium compounds, mixtures containing tritium in which the ratio of tritium to hydrogen atoms exceeds 1 part in 1,000, and products or devices containing any of the foregoing. All these products are subject to export, import and transit control. the control list does not control a product or device containing less than 1,48 × 10 3 GBq (40 Ci) of tritium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe working group:\nKhalilov Rovshan\nGuluzade Cafar\nNasibova Aygun\nAliyev Mirzali\nMuradi Imran\nSultanova Gunel\nAliyev Yashar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\nSection 1. Brief overview of International and National legislative framework\nAzerbaijan has been the member of many international bilateral multilateral treaties and agreements in the field of export control. However, in most organizations, the country has the status of state party. On the basis of mentioned international documents country established own national normative legal base as well.\nIn terms of main implementation of above-mentioned document requirements, it has been implemented the following actions so far:\n·        determination of obligations and responsibilities of state body\n·        creation of coordination and collaboration between authorized bodies\n·        establishment of joint commission behind Cabinet of Ministers which is considered to control authorized body in the field of export control\n·        determination of licensing mechanisms and other issues at national level\n\n\nAdditionally, these national mechanisms and requirements are also illustrated in the Export Control Handbook of the country. Azerbaijan has a great interest to research international best experience in the field of export control. In order to archive this goal the country has taken part in a lot of workshops, practical training proqrammes which are organized by BAFA and other international institutes so far. Behind that, it is also organizing annually some workshops for the customs authorities.\nIn accordance with the national law on export control The State Customs Committee is not responsible for issuing export control lisenses for the stakeholders. By the law, the customs authorities have right to check the completeness of all required documents as well as the special permits depending on Harmonized Code of goods. Depending on that code of goods and means of transport, the holder of procedure should submit special permit to the customs authorities with other mandatory documents.\nThe list of dual use goods was accepted by the Decree of Cabinet of Ministers. Currently. it is making some amendments to list in order to fully adapt the international standards and requirements. The completion of this update period of current legislation it should be given the information on that.\n\n\n1.1. International bilateral and multilateral Treaties and Agreements\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nhttps://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/\n\n\nAzerbaijan ratified the NPT on September 22, 1992. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was ratified by Azerbaijan on 2 February 1999.\n\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) https://www.ctbto.org/\n \nAzerbaijan signed it on July 28, 1997 and ratified it on February 2, 1999.\n\n\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (OPCW)  https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention\n\n\nAzerbaijan signed The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), officially the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction January 13, 1993 and ratified on February 29, 2000.\n \nThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BTWC) https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/\n\n\nAzerbaijan signed the BTWC on February 26, 2004 and ratified it on June 06, 2005.\n \nThe Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC)\nhttps://www.hcoc.at/?tab=what_is_hcoc&page=text_of_the_hcoc\n \nAzerbaijan joined The HCOC on November 25, 2002. The Code does not call for the destruction of any missiles, it is simply an agreement between States on how they should “conduct” their trade in missiles. \n\n\nSecurity Initiative against Proliferation (PSI) www.armscontrol.org\nAzerbaijan supports and participates in this international initiative. \nContainer Security Initiative (CSI)\nAzerbaijan is participating as state party in this initiative/ \n \nThe Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) https://thearmstradetreaty.org/\nTo date, the treaty has 110 member states and 31 signatory countries that have not yet ratified it.\nAzerbaijan did not sign ATT, consequently no ratification is evident.\n \nNON-PROLIFERATION REGIMES\nNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/ \nAzerbaijan is not a member country of NSG. Today NSG unites 48 countries. \n\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) http://mtcr.info/\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the station was leased and operated by Russia's Aerospace Defense Forces, providing Russia with a residual strategic foothold in Azerbaijan. Russia has transferred control of the facility to the government of Azerbaijan, which transferred the facility out of its Armed Forces inventory to the State Committee on Property Issues.\n\n\nAustralia group (AG) https://australiagroup.net/en/index.html\n \n\n\nAzerbaijan is not participating in the Australia Group.\n \nThe Wassenaar Agreement (WA) https://www.wassenaar.org/\nNo participation of Azerbaijan in the group of WA\n \nZangger Committee http://zanggercommittee.org/\nAlso known as the \"NPT Exporters Committee\"\n\n\nAzerbaijan is not a member of The Zangger Committee. \nProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\nhttps://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/bio/1925-geneva-protocol/\nAzerbaijan is non-party to this Geneva Protocol.\n1.2. Legal Framework of Azerbaijan\n \nLegislation points in the export control system in Azerbaijan are issued according to the European system, but not limited to. Those are criteria of permission issuance, refusal or suspension; documentations for acquiring permissions; methods and approaches for implementation of control,\n \nAzerbaijan team briefly researched the division of the structure at Customs Committee and also their functions. Although Section 2 was not widely researched during the Q1 (it will study more widely during Q2), however some outlines were systemized.\n \nThe legal framework governing export controls at the national level considers international non-proliferation obligations in Azerbaijan, also guidelines for multilateral and bilateral export control regimes in the country, and includes EU standards in dual-use items control approach.\nControl of dual-use items in Azerbaijan is structured by the below-mentioned normative acts: international treaties and agreements; control of military and dual use items; licenses and permits; customs code; criminal code; general administrative code; special orders of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan related to the dual use export control.\n \nThe Customs Code of Azerbaijan explains the rules and regulations of import of such goods into the customs area and also export of such goods. There are a number of normative documents within Customs code, such as for solving disputable deals, customs violations, the procedures for customs authorities, movement of goods through the border. Besides, Azerbaijan successfully implements electronic system for obtaining permission with regards to the dual-use items, getting licensing and certificates. This system is an electronic module which allows electronically govern structures issuing licenses, permits and certificates based on the legislation of Azerbaijani customs in terms of dual-use export control. \nSection 2. Basic customs procedures\nCustoms procedure means any of the special customs procedures of export, re-export, temporary export, release for free circulation, re-import, under which goods and means of transport that are under the customs control can be placed pursuant to provisions of the Customs Code of Azerbaijan. In accordance with the national customs legislation customs clearance means actions on placing of goods and means of transport under the relevant customs procedure and completion of that customs procedure. For the purposes of customs legislation*, all customs procedures divided into the following groups:\n\n\n\ncustoms procedures\n\n\t\n\nspecial customs procedures\n\n\n\n\nRelease for free circulation\n\nExport\n\nRe – import\n\nRe – export\n\nTemporary export\n\n\t\n\nTransit (international and domestic)\n\nProcessing (inward and outward)\n\nStorage (Temporary storage and customs Warehouse)\n\nSpecial use (temporary admission and end use)\n\nFree zone\n\n* Customs legislation consists of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, this Code, Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Customs Tariff and other normative legal act and international agreements adopted in accordance with them, of which the Republic of Azerbaijan is the participant.\n \n*Brief information about national customs procedures\nRelease for free circulation means the customs procedure under which goods imported to the customs territory shall be released for free circulation on this territory following payment of all customs duties and taxes and fulfillment of the required customs clearance prescribed by legislation. Foreign goods placed under the customs procedure of release for free circulation obtain status of internal goods.\nForeign goods intended to be put on internal market for sell, consumption and use shall be placed under the customs procedure of release for free circulation.\nCustoms procedure of release for free circulation leads to the following:\ncollection of customs payments determined by legislation;\napplication of trade policy measures;\ncompletion of the other procedures determined in respect of importation of goods.\nrelease of goods – İf declarant respond all the requirements and conditions that prescribed in customs legislation the customs authority immediately carry out the release of the goods. The declarant also have to submit the customs declaration to the customs clearance office as well. All goods covered by the same customs declaration shall be released by the customs authorities at the same time.\n\n\nExport:\n Internal goods exported beyond the customs territory and intended for permanent stay beyond its borders shall be placed under the customs procedure of export.\nThe following cases are excluded:\n·        goods placed under the special customs procedure of end-use or processing out of customs territory;\n·        goods placed under the special customs procedure of internal transit or temporary exported from the customs\n\n\n Re–export: \n \nRe-export of foreign goods 128.1. When foreign goods are exported form the customs territory, customs authorities carry out their export clearance and submit notification on re-export for presentation to other competent customs authorities.\nThe following cases are excluded:\n·        goods placed under the special customs procedure of international transit which cross customs territory;\n·        goods reloaded from one means of transport to another within free zone or directly re-exported from free zone;\n·      goods placed under the special customs procedure of temporary storage which directly have been re-exported from the place of temporary storage. Amounts of import or export duties and taxes paid in respect of goods re- exported from the customs territory within 1 (one) year from the moment of release for free circulation shall be reimbursed where such goods meet requirements defined by the relevant executive authority. \n   Transit:\n    Transit means special customs procedure of conveyance of goods under the customs control from one customs authority to another customs authority.\n      Special customs procedure of international customs transit shall be customs procedure where foreign goods are conveyed across the customs territory under the customs control between two points without payment of customs duties, value added tax and excises, as well as without appliance to the goods of trade policy measures. Conveyance of goods under the special customs procedure of international transit shall be implemented in the following order:\n·        conveyance of goods began or is to end outside the customs territory;\n·        conveyance of goods shall be implemented between two points of the customs territory through the territory outside the customs territory.\nRe-importation shall be exported goods fully or partially returned into the customs territory within 3 (three) years from the moment of exportation in the same condition, i.e. without any processing in the foreign country, and shall be released for free circulation with full exemption from import customs duties and taxes, as well as without application of economic policy measures to these goods.\n\n\n    Goods under free circulation or goods of inward processing can be placed under the customs procedure of re-importation.\nSection 3. Classifier of customs documents\n*Customs declaration types\nDeclaration means oral, written or electronic submission of information to the customs authorities on goods and means of transport conveyed across the customs border of the Republic of Azerbaijan (hereinafter customs border) placed under the customs control.\n     For the different purposes the following customs declarations are using:\n·        Main customs declaration – for standard case the declarant can use the main form for customs and special customs procedures;\n·        short import declaration - which is submitted in electronic form and before crossing the customs borders. This type of declaration is considered to carry out risk analyzes in advance and gives opportunity to apply customs control forms in selective format;\n·        short export declaration – when goods directly exporting from temporary storage places the persons have to submit this sort of declaration to the relevant customs office;\n·        simplified customs declaration - shall be submitted to the customs authority in the following cases:\n\n\n·        placing of goods under the relevant customs procedure by authorized economic operators;\n·        customs clearance of humanitarian goods;\n·        conveyance by the natural persons across the customs border of goods not intended for manufacturing or commercial purposes but subject to declaring in written form;\n·        additional customs declaration - In case of submission of simplified declaration (for AEO and humanitarian goods) the declarant fills in additional declaration containing other data required for filling of customs declaration for the declared customs procedure.\n·        periodic customs declaration - where the same goods and means of transport are conveyed by the same person regularly, customs authorities may permit issue of one periodic declaration on goods and means of transport conveyed across the customs border within certain period;\n·        incomplete customs declaration - where declarant in virtue of reasonable excuse cannot submit complete customs declaration, customs authorities may permit submission of incomplete customs declaration in the order determined by the relevant executive authority;\nRe – export notification – within the re-export customs procedure holder of procedure have to submit re-export notification to border customs office.\nOther documents:\nThe following documents are required for customs control:\n·        Transport documents,\n·        Declaration containing information on goods and means of transport.\n\n\n       In order to place the goods under the relevant customs procedure (special customs procedure), the declarant is obliged to submit the following documents to the customs office with the customs declaration.\n \n·        A contract confirming the implementation of foreign trade or a document confirming the right of a person to own, use and (or) dispose of goods, or any other document;\n·        Transport documents depending on the type of transport during transportation of goods and means of transport.\n \nTaking into account the category of goods, mode of transportation and other features with the customs declaration the following documents must be submitted to customs office:\n·        in case of direct or indirect customs representation, the relevant confirming documents;\n·        document that shows the customs debt has already paid;\n·        a document confirming the declared customs value of imported goods;\n·        license for import, transit and export of plant protection products and:\n·        agrochemicals or precursors;\n·        certificate of conformity (for mandatory certified goods)\n·        veterinary certificate;\n·        food safety certificate;\n·        phytosanitary certificate;\n·        quality certificate;\n·        order of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on import of goods specified in “Rules of regulation of import – export operations in the Republic of Azerbaijan “approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan N 609 of June 24, 1997 or opinions of relevant government agencies;\n·        special permit for export, import, re-export, re-import and transit of goods under export control.\n\n\n*Note: We have been expanding our research in this dimension. Above mentioned material has only brief informative character.\n Section 4. Transportation of strategic goods, as well as, transportation of dangerous goods\n\n\nAzerbaijan has a Caspian Sea port at Alat, southwest of Baku. Alat is situated at a rail and road hub, allowing for multimodal north-south and east-west transit and can accommodate rail ferries that transport up to 52 train cars at a time. The Alat Customs Port creates a potential transit route for trade, transportation of strategic goods between East, Central, and South Asia and Europe. In terms of transportation, Azerbaijan has also vastly expanded its air cargo facilities with cold storage and a modern general cargo terminal at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku. These air cargo facilities will complement Azerbaijan’s investments in road, port, and rail infrastructure.\n       Azerbaijan’s geographic location creates some challenging position from the viewpoint of the fact that countries in the region are subject to sanctions or types of trade restrictions which recent events demonstrate and prove those facts. This increases the importance of the export control system in the region.\n      Based on the definition, strategic goods are considered to be the goods that have strategic meaning and significance, both military and civilian from the viewpoint of security and international acceptance. The transportation of such goods and consequently services (eg., digital transmission of software and/or technology, technical assistance or intermediate trading) is subject to a number of rules\n\n\nAll goods and means of transportation imported into the customs territory and exported from this territory irrespective whether they are subject to customs duties and taxes shall be subject to the customs control.\n\n\nCustoms authorities implement the customs control for the purposes of ensuring fulfillment of customs legislation regulating arrival of goods and means of transportation at the customs territory or their departure from this territory, transit across this territory and end-use, other legislation and international agreements, control on fulfillment of which shall be imposed on the customs authorities.\n\n\nModern technologies and equipment shall be used during customs control.\nThe customs officials implement the customs control as the following:\n\n\n·        control of goods and means of transportation;\n·        personal inspection;\n·        checking of information required for the customs purposes, documents in writing on electronic or paper materials, including accompaniment of goods conveyed across the state border crossing points of the Republic of Azerbaijan, veterinary, phyto-sanitary, hygienic and other certificates;\n·        customs audit;\n·        interrogation of persons;\n·        customs examination of goods and means of transportation subject to the customs control, territories and premises, warehouses of temporary storage and customs warehouses, territories and premises located in free zones and other places where activity control on which is imposed on the customs authorities shall be implemented;\n·        patrolling and customs surveillance.\n\n\nOn the strategic goods, customs authorities may conduct additional inspection measures in order to ensure the security issues, especially depending on their chemical and physical features; to be aware of the customs control measures at border crossing points and customs clearance places.\nCustoms control is conducted in the three different stages. Within these stages customs authorities carry out all measures on the goods and means of transportation in terms of the prescribed obligations and responsibilities. In accordance with the 113th article of the Customs Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan the economic operator should submit the short import declaration before arrival of means of transport to the customs territory. By using the data of the mentioned declaration customs authorities are able to conduct the customs control measures in a selective and risk based way. During the registration stage all means of transportation must be registered at Border Control Post (BCP). The short import declaration is the crucial base for the risk management system as well. \n(SAMS)\n\n\nActions related to the registration of trucks in SAMS\nThe goods and means of transport should be registered in SAMS at border crossing point. For the registration at border checkpoints most information was delivered in advance by short import declaration. However, customs inspector include date (which is not delivered with SID) manually. For instance, the information on truck driver etc. We are working to update the new form of Short customs declaration and by using the new form of mentioned document it is not required any physical action in terms of registration of goods and means of transport. In order to change the data content of SID we took the best practice of international approach (Summary Entry Declaration, TIR EPD (Electronic Pre arrival declaration) and so on. \nRegistration is implementing in “Single Window” room at BCPs. \nFirst stage: Border Line procedures\n\n\nFirstly, Border protection authorities (not customs official) release the persons, goods and means of transport from the state border of country on the basis of valid document.\n\n\nSecond stage: TRS, Time Release Camera.\n\n\nFor measuring the time limits regarding crossing time of goods and means of transport the TRS camera is installed near by the Portal Radiation Monitor. The TRS Camera is capable to record the means of transport template number then this data will be transferred to Single Window Room (to registration officer). TRS camera is also used for the confirmation of arrival of vehicles to the customs border. By using these transferred data, the customs official also obtains the opportunity to keep under control the existency of SID. \nWe are working to establish the new Working Group to analyze the TRS camera data for the fulfillment of WCOs recommendation in that field. TRS methodology helps to customs to improve the border procedures and to decrease the time limits required for the border prosedures and customs clearance places.\n\n\nThird stage: Portal Radiation Unit\n\n\nIn accordance with the current legislation on radiation protection mainly the three government agencies are responsible for the fulfillment of preventive measures. They are: Ministry of Emergency Situations, The Border Protection Service and State Customs Committee. Within the process if it is emerged any radiation signal depending on the level of dangerous situation, the issues also must be coordinated with the relevant authorities (Ministry of Health, Food Safety Agency). The customs officials shall help to the main agencies in the process.\n\n\nFourth Stage: Automated Disinfection Unit.\n\n\nIn accordance with the current legislation, the customs officials conduct sanitary quarantine measures at BCPs. (with Border Protection Service). The Technological Scheme adopted among the State Customs Committee, Border Protection Service and Ministry of Health related to the sanitary hazardous and human diseases. At BCPs three control measured lines were created by the customs authorities. This preventive measures also might be conducted by using the new generation of technical devices. Automated Disinfection Unit is the best tool to implement the preventive measures at BCPs. During pandemic time the customs officials undertake to implement all preventive measures against COVID and other diseases. All BCPs were supplied the modern automated disinfection units and other equipment (thermal imager for persons).\nIf the Unit detects any threat, the customs authorities ensure the isolation and PZR laboratory issues, as well.\n\n\nFifth stage: Identification of weight indicators of transport vehicle.\n\n\nThe customs authorities measure the means of transport at BCPs. The weight bridge is integrated with the Single Window room. After weight bridge stage if customs inspect detects any difference between the transport documents and Weight bridge indicator, then this difference should be added as amendment to the document. During the calculation of customs value and applying of customs tariff, the destination office inspector should take into account this difference. Within the declaring process, the customs representative also takes into account mentioned amendment.\n\n\nSixth stage: Passport control\n\n\nThe Border Protection Service officials register and verify the documents of persons passing through the BCPs, ensure the information to the İner – Departmental Automated Information – Search System.\n\n\nSeventh stage: Customs examination\n\n\nThe customs examination teams which include the professional examination experts are conducting customs control measures on the goods and means of transport. The Automated Risk Management System and the customs inspector (manually) can make decision conducting customs examination. During the examination process, customs inspectors implement the physical examination on the goods and means of transport.\n \nSection 5. Risk management system in relation to goods subject to customs clearance\nIn order to decrease the risk and to promote the effective methods of customs control, the customs authorities use the technical devices for the purposes of conducting customs control. Above-mentioned Technical devices are vastly used by the customs authorities.\n       \nFor risk conduction based on customs control, the customs authorities create the risk profiles on the specific category of the goods and means of transportation. The process is totally automated, so that, the detailed information on the strategic and dual use goods is integrated the Automated Risk Management System (ARMS). Within the border crossing operations the system automatically sends the informative signals for the customs officials. Above-mentioned information base is regularly renewed and upgraded.\nAt the customs clearance, the system has other risk profiles that help to customs officials to select the relevant customs control form.\nWithin the process the manual risk also might be detected by the customs officials. However, in that case, the customs officials may designate the customs expertise in order to clarify the code of goods and other features.\nAlthough the Risk Management steps are not well-established and developed, the following stages are important: identification of the risk context; risk analysis; assessment of risk; risk profiling.\n Section 6. Interaction of the Customs Service with the authorities, agencies and stakeholders\n\n\n       In accordance with the 12th article of Customs Code For the purposes of fulfillment of their responsibilities the customs authorities cooperate with other state authorities, including legal and natural persons, law-enforcement authorities. Officials of state authorities should create appropriate conditions with regard to the fulfillment of their responsibilities for the customs authorities.\nFor the purposes of international trade facilitation, the customs authorities carry out veterinary, phytosanitary and other forms of control determined by the relevant executive authority of the goods on the state border crossing points, in the shortest time possible on the basis of ‘single window’ principle. The customs authorities and other state authorities for the purposes of reduction of risks, provision of security of activity of international trade supply chain, facilitation of conditions for foreign trade, implement information sharing among themselves and with the customs and other competent state authorities of other countries in the order determined by the relevant executive authority with regard to arrival, departure and transit of the goods and means of transport to customs territory conveyed across the customs border. To modernize the customs service and provide more favorable conditions for business and international trade, adopted the \"State Program on development of the customs system of the Azerbaijan Republic for 2007 to 2011.\" Under this Programme, 11 November 2008, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan signed the \"Decree on the application of the principle of\" single window \"for inspecting the goods and vehicles transported across the border checkpoints of the Azerbaijan Republic\". Thus, from January 1, 2009 in Azerbaijan in the clearance of goods and cargoes at the customs border the \"single window\" system was implemented. Prior to implementing the principle of “single window” the system for registration of papers operated with a local database of each stakeholder: veterinary services, plant quarantine services, sanitation and quarantine service. In this case, it should be noted that among these services do not exist the electronic data exchange. Firstly, a unified, centralized database at the Customs Committee was developed. Further, a system of registration of goods and vehicles at the border and this system was adapted to the business process of each service separately.\nThe existing model of the “Single Window” was built on the Unified Automated System of Customs Management and e-customs service of Azerbaijan, which has accelerated the implementation of single window. The system \"Single Window\" is built on a platform of information technology, customs registration and automated customs management systems and risk management systems. Importers, exporters, freight forwarders, brokers, as well as other governmental bodies, using this system, refer to customs in the \"Single Window\". After signing the decree \"on the application of the principle of\" single window \"for inspecting the goods and vehicles transported across the border checkpoints of the Azerbaijan Republic\" the State Customs Committee of Azerbaijan began to implement the project and took the following steps:\n- to analyze the business process at the state border of Azerbaijan inspection of goods and vehicles transported across the checkpoints;\n- to organize a commission under the Customs Committee to implement the principle of \"single window\";\n- to improve human resource capacity in local customs and learn from best international practices;\n- to create a flow chart of the principle of \"Single Window\";\n - The customs authorities have begun to inspect documents for goods and vehicles crossing the state border crossing points of the Azerbaijan Republic, including veterinary, phytosanitary, sanitary and other certificates (certificates) for goods, and veterinary, phytosanitary, sanitary control of these goods on border;\n- set hardware and software;\n- has monitored the results of implementing the pilot project \"Single Window\" at the state borders.\n - in the framework of infrastructure development border customs checkpoints have been constructed and reconstructed, can support a single window system.\n- The customs authorities at the border began to veterinary and phytosanitary control through the control of veterinary, phytosanitary and sanitary certificates and other authorizations and issuance of permit forms.\nCustoms Committee builds new customs checkpoints on the border of the international level. These checkpoints cover all areas of the state border of Azerbaijan. Other customs checkpoints have been reconstructed and provided with new technical equipment.\nThe principle of “single window” provides the following features:\n • Information regarding the border crossing at entry and exit of goods and vehicles;\n • Exchange of electronic certificates of the relevant ministries: the phytosanitary, veterinary and sanitary and quarantine services;\n• Information about the declared goods;\n• Preliminary information on vehicles crossing the border;\n • Report regarding registered facts of customs offenses;\n• Various financial reports; • A report on foreign exchange savings.\nSo far the system was upgraded many times step by step. \nOver the “single window” principle the SCC (State Customs Committee) has the electronic integration with the above mentioned government agencies.\nFuture approach to “Single Window” principle:\n \nThe project \"Electronic Customs\" (e-Customs), which is one of the components of the \"Electronic Azerbaijan\" (\"e-Azerbaijan\") program, covers one of the main areas of the state program on development of the customs system (2007-2011). For this reason, the project \"e-Customs\" is based on legal and regulatory documents created within the framework of \"e-Azerbaijan\". Therefore, completion of the project \"e-Customs\" is closely related to the implementation of \"e-Azerbaijan\".\nCreating a system of \"e-Customs\" is one of the main objectives of the Strategy of Information and Communication Technologies of Azerbaijan State Customs Committee and mainly consists of three subsystems:\nUnified automated control system in the customs service;\nInformation management system of Internet resources;\nCorporate Portal - an intranet system of the Customs Committee.\n\"E-Customs\", mainly based on the SCC project being conducted in \"unified automated control system in the customs service,\" which consists of the following modules:\nElectronic customs control systems;\nAutomatic customs procedures;\nThe automated control system and operations center to combat smuggling and violations;\nAutomatic financial activities;\nThe automated registration system of currency;\nResource Management System;\nAutomate your workflow;\nThe risk management system;\nAutomated control system for enterprise resource planning (ERP);\nThe system of \"e-service\" for maintenance;\nAutomated control system of \"single window\" to check the goods and vehicles crossing the road crossings of the border.\nModules are implemented in phases, projects for the integration of information resources of other state bodies of the country, which will be completed within the \"E-Azerbaijan\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 7. Liability for violation of customs rules and procedures\n\n\n      The customs authorities are the authorities of interrogation and investigation on cases of customs crimes. Conduct of interrogation and investigation and implementation of procedural activity by the customs authorities governed by the Criminal Procedure Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n       Investigation of cases of administrative violations of the customs rules, examination of such cases as well as implemented proceedings, forms of administrative punishment applied for the administrative violations governed by Administrative Offences Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n      The customs authorities implement operational and investigation activities with a view to suppression and detecting crimes, investigative proceedings and interrogation identification of the persons responsible for preparing, committing and having committed such crimes which the customs authority shall be in charge of.\n        In the Code of the Azerbaijan Republic on Administrative violations one chapter is totally related to customs rules (Administrative misconduct, encroaching on customs rules).\nIn this respective chapter there are some articles regarding the violations of customs rules and procedures. For example there are: transportation of goods and transport vehicles via customs border of Azerbaijan Republic without customs control, concealing from customs control of goods transported via customs border of Azerbaijan Republic, transportation of goods and transport vehicles via customs border of Azerbaijan Republic with deceptive use of documents or means of identification, non-declaration or non-verified declaration of goods and transport vehicles, release of goods, transport vehicles and its documents without permission of corresponding body of executive power of Azerbaijan Republic or non-delivery to corresponding body of executive power of Azerbaijan Republic and etc.\n     Depending of the capacity of violations it might be considered as the crime. In the criminal code of Azerbaijan smuggling, not returning on territory of the Azerbaijan Republic of subjects of art, historical and archeology property of the Azerbaijan Republic and foreign countries, not returning from abroad of means in foreign currency, evasion from payment of customs charges, the violations on export control and others were considered as crime.\n     Azerbaijan’s customs authorities regularly carry out necessary operational and search measures to prevent customs offenses, including illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and their precursors, as well as identify and prosecute persons involved in preparing and committing crimes of this kind, with identification of risk indicators and through appropriate analysis. The customs control is carried out using technical control means and the involvement of dogs from the canine service.\n \nSection 8. National commodity nomenclature of foreign economic affairs \nCustoms duties on import and export of goods are based on the customs tariff. Other measures provided by the legislation regarding the import and export of goods are applied according to the tariff classification of these goods.\nOne of the bases on which the customs tariff is applied is the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity. During the application of customs payments to the declared goods, their code corresponding to the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity is taken as the basis. When calculating the amount of customs debt for customs duties, the measurement unit and customs value reflected in the goods nomenclature of the foreign economic activity of the Republic of Azerbaijan are taken as the basis. The goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity is a classification that includes the group, position, auxiliary position, sub-auxiliary position of the goods in the form of a number sign or a group of number signs (codes).\nInterpretation rules of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity and comments (notes) on positions at any classification level are an integral part of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity. The goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity used in the Republic of Azerbaijan should be in accordance with the Harmonized System of interpretation and coding of goods of the World Customs Organization, Combined System of the European Union and the uniform goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nGoods nomenclature of foreign economic activity of The Republic of Azerbaijan, rate of import customs duties and rate of export customs duties and basic interpretation rules of goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity it was approved by the decision no. 500 of the Cabinet of Ministers of The Republic of Azerbaijan dated November 17, 2017.\nCarrying out the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity\n•     ensures monitoring of changes and additions to the international bases of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity, international comments (notes) and decisions on the interpretation of these bases, and prompt application in customs work;\n•     prepares proposals for adapting the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity to its international basis;\n•     together with the relevant executive authorities, ensures the development of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity, the preparation of proposals for changes and additions to it;\n•     represents the Republic of Azerbaijan in international organizations dealing with the preparation of the international bases of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity, changes and additions to it, its interpretation and application;\n•     ensures the publication of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity;\n•     ensures the publication of international comments (notes) and decisions on the interpretation of the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity, its international basis;\n•     provides the relevant executive authorities with international explanations and decisions on the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity and its interpretation;\n•     provides a detailed description of goods by type in the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity;\n•     ensures the performance of other functions on conducting the goods nomenclature of foreign economic activity\n\n\nSection 9.

No country in the world is safe from threat of use of IEDs by terrorist and other criminal organizations. Recently, the world has witnessed an increase in the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other homemade explosive devices manufactured from the illicit diversion and trafficking of precursor chemical shipments.\nIn this occasion, there is a Programme Global Shield which focuses on the high risk precursor chemicals as identified by industry experts as posing the greatest threat for use as explosives. The Precursor chemicals to IED, their chemical name, other common names, HS code and CAS code, common use are summarized in the specific table.\nStatement (order) for receipt of special permission:\nfor legal entities - the name, legal address of the legal entity and type of the external economic transaction performed by means of special permission;\n for physical persons - name, middle name, surname, data of the identity certificate (series, number, date and the name, and the address of the organization which issued the certificate);\n information on the receiver of goods (sender of goods) and end user;\n the copy of the signed agreement (contract);\n the copy of the certificate of origin of the exported goods.\n the copy of the certificate on acceptance on accounting of customers (applicants) by tax authorities\nResponsibility for violation of the legislation of the Azerbaijan Republic on export control\nLegal entities and individuals of the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as foreign countries, violating the legislation on export control, shall be held civil, administrative and criminal liable in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nCapacity building measures\nCapacity building measures carrying out mainly in two levels\nScience and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU) – Targeted Initiative funded by the European Union\nUS State Department programs (EXBX Program)\nIn 2016, the STCE ad-hoc project had turned into a long term STCE programme.

Case studies of customs clearance and customs control of dual use goods\nCustoms plays an essential role on regulating of dual use items. İnternational standards are built on a foundation of core Customs capabilities such as risk assessment, targeting, inspection, and audit. Using these capabilities, Customs ensures that cross-border movements of goods comply with national laws and regulations. In accordance with the 275th article of Customs Code customs authorities is determined as bodies of export control and customs authorities exercise export control according to the procedure, established by this Code and the Law of the Azerbaijan Republic \"About export control\". \nIn accordance with the 276.1th article customs authorities stop illicit movement through customs border of the goods falling under export control, including commodity export to the states and to end users to which export of these goods is prohibited or limited. Officials of customs authorities, authorized to exercise export control, shall observe confidentiality of information obtained by them from other state bodies and persons having participation.\nVerification and Commodity Identification\nWhen a shipment is targeted for Customs verification, based on risk-assessment as discussed, several options may be considered. These should be applied in a progressive manner, beginning with least invasive and disruptive and progressing as necessary. Three kinds of inspection/control are considered here:\n·       Documentary examination (often conducted electronically)\n·       Technical examination (often with portal monitors, container x-ray scans, other detection systems)\n·        Physical examination (putting eyes, hands, and/or instruments on the goods)\n \nIn order to ensure the transparency in examination process the State Customs Committee promote the e- services in this field.\n\n\n\n\nThe customs control measures \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the informing and registration, phase customs authorities are able to verify the information that submitted in advance by the declarants by using the Risk \nManagement system profiles or manually. In documentary control phace the customs authorities require to submitte relevant special permission from the holder of customs procedure.\n\n\n\n\nThe border Crossing points designed in the above mentioned form. The opeations and prcodures should be done by customs stuff as the illustrated sequence. In the customs clearance phase the stakeholders add the special permission to the 31st box of customs declaration as a necessary additional document. According to the rules of submitting of customs declaration the all border risk profiles automatically filter the all pre – arrival information, as well as the short import declaration.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nჩამოტვირთვა\nგაზიარება\nუკუკავშირი\nაგრეთვე ეძებენ\nდოკუმენტის სტატისტიკა\n\n390\n\nდოკუმენტის დათვალიერება\n\ninfohub@rs.ge",
